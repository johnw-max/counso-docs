# Download a conversation-scoped file by path

Streams a conversation-mounted file using its scoped path. Prefer the canonical filePath listed under a message action's generatedFiles; the older conversation/foo.pdf form is also accepted. Paths belonging to another conversation or scope, including traversal with .., are rejected.

```http
GET /api/v1/w/{wId}/assistant/conversations/{cId}/files/{rel}
```

Base URL: `https://app.counso.ai`

## Authentication

Send a workspace API key or a user OAuth access token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The credential must belong to this Counso deployment and have access to the requested workspace and resources.

## Parameters

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `wId` | path | string | Yes | ID of the workspace |
| `cId` | path | string | Yes | ID of the conversation |
| `rel` | path | string | Yes | Conversation-scoped file path: the canonical `filePath` returned in a message<br>action's `generatedFiles`, or the legacy `conversation/foo.pdf` form. Paths<br>scoped to another conversation or to a different scope are rejected. Path<br>traversal segments (`..`) are rejected.<br> |
