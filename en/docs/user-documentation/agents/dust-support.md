# Product support guidance

The Support Skill described here is a product-help capability that may be available in the workspace. If it appears in Agent Builder, add it from **Capabilities** or make it discoverable to Agents as appropriate. Do not assume a separate support bot or private account access is included.

When enabled, the Skill can search the public product documentation and other public product sources configured for it, then ground a how-to answer in those materials. It can distinguish a product-use question from a suspected bug or a private account matter. For a suspected bug, collect reproduction steps, expected and actual behavior, the visible error, and relevant environment details.

The Skill can help prepare a report, but it does not submit an issue on the user's behalf. It cannot inspect private workspace settings, billing records, logs, or account state; make promises about fixes or service timelines; or replace the organization's support contact for account-specific questions. When public sources do not answer, it should say so and identify the appropriate support route provided by the organization.

For configuration help, start with the relevant [Counso documentation](../getting-started/intro-to-dust.md).
