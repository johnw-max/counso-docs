# Data sources and tools

An Agent uses material and capabilities from several distinct places. A **Connection** syncs selected provider data for retrieval. A **Tool** performs live operations against a provider using an authorized identity. A **website source** crawls public pages. A **Folder** holds uploaded documents or tables. Files attached to a conversation give that conversation temporary, local context.

Choose the route that matches the work: use a Connection for recurring search across selected material, a Tool for a current record or an action, a website source for public linked pages, a Folder for a maintained collection of uploaded material, and an attachment for a one-off task. These routes have separate permissions and refresh behavior. Adding a source does not grant a Tool access, and adding a Tool does not make all provider content searchable.

Workspace administrators or Space builders configure shared sources. Before relying on results, confirm the destination Space, source scope, acting identity, and last refresh; then ask an Agent to find a known item and compare it with the provider.
