## Overview

<Warning>

</Warning>

The Google Sheets tool is deprecated. Migrate to the Google Drive tool, which supports reading and editing Google Sheets via tools like Get Spreadsheet, Get Worksheet, Append to Spreadsheet, and Update Spreadsheet.

each user.

* **List Spreadsheets** Use Google Drive: Search Files (filter to spreadsheets) or Get Spreadsheet when you know the ID.
* **Get Spreadsheet / Get Worksheet** Use Google Drive: Get Spreadsheet / Get Worksheet.
* **Append Data / Update Cells / Format Cells / Clear Range / Copy Sheet / Add/Delete/Rename/Move Worksheet** Use Google Drive: Append to Spreadsheet / Update Spreadsheet.

## Admin: Setup in Google Cloud

A Google Workspace account is required for the following steps.

### Create a Client App

Go to [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com). Pick one of your project or create a new one. Then in the search bar, type "*Google Auth platform*" and pick "Clients".

Create a new client:

**Fill in basic information**

* Application type: "Web application".
* External Client App Name: "Dust Gsheets Integration".
* Authorized javascript origins: [https://dust.tt](https://dust.tt) and [https://eu.dust.tt](https://eu.dust.tt)
* Authorized redirect URIs: [https://dust.tt/oauth/gmail/finalize](https://dust.tt/oauth/gmail/finalize) and [https://eu.dust.tt/oauth/gmail/finalize](https://eu.dust.tt/oauth/gmail/finalize)

## Admin: Setup in Dust

Pick Create and on the next screen, copy the Client ID and Client Secret (you'll need them for the Dust setup):

Go to Spaces > Tools in your Dust workspace, click `Add Tools`, and select Google Sheets.
