# Changelog

> New updates and improvements to Dust

<Update label="September 10th, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## Assign Admin and Manager roles from any workspace group

  Admins can now assign the Admin or Manager role to any workspace group from Settings & Governance → Roles, without relying on groups named `dust-admins` or `dust-managers`. This supports manually managed groups as well as groups provisioned from your identity provider.

  Existing `dust-admins` and `dust-managers` groups are migrated automatically, so current role assignments continue to work. Available to all workspace admins.
</Update>

<Update label="September 8th, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## Flexible space and pod permissions

  You can now manage access to spaces and pods with individual members and groups at the same time. Spaces no longer require choosing between member-based or group-based access, and pods can be managed with groups as well as individual users.

  Use the member and group management controls in your space or pod settings to configure access as your teams grow.
</Update>

<Update label="September 5th, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## GPT6 Astra

  GPT6 Astra is now available in Dust. You can select it when choosing a model for your agents and conversations.
</Update>

<Update label="August 26th, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## Credit pool usage for triggers

  Triggers can now run on the workspace pool of credits on credit-priced plans and on the programmatic usage pool on seat-based plans. Admins can control who can use these pools, while trigger editors can choose the pool in the trigger edition sheet and track usage from the Automations page. This gives you more granular control over credit allocation.
</Update>

<Update label="August 14th, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## Slack auto-replies without an @mention

  You can now configure a Dust agent to reply in a Slack channel without requiring the @Dust app mention. Set the agent to respond to every message or only the first message in a new thread, depending on how much automation you want in that channel. Available to every workspace.
</Update>

<Update label="August 10th, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## Choose the model from the composer

  [Watch the model demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50fae19e-f5e5-42ec-803b-6d5af30a9071)

  You can now choose which model runs your agent directly from the message composer. Click the model icon to choose a specific model or one of Dust's three auto models: **Basic**, **Standard**, and **Premium**.

  Each auto model is an ordered list of model and reasoning-effort combinations maintained by Dust. We periodically benchmark the candidates and update the lists when the preferred model changes. Dust does not route each request to a different model based on the task. When you send a message, Dust uses the first candidate on the selected list that is available to your workspace. If a candidate is unavailable, Dust continues to the next one.

  The model picker works with any agent, including the default `@dust` agent. A selection in the composer applies to your next message in that conversation only. To make a persistent choice, set the model in Agent Builder.

  The global model agents no longer appear in your agent list, but the models that powered them remain available through **More models** in the picker when your plan and administrator settings allow them. These agents were wrappers around a model with access to internet search, rather than full agents with their own instructions, tools, or company knowledge.

  Custom agents pinned to a specific model keep that model. Custom agents that previously followed the default model now run on **Standard**.

  The model picker is available in every workspace where the feature is enabled. Legacy pricing workspaces cannot select Premium models.
</Update>

<Update label="August 10th, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## Restrict access to model tiers

  Admins can now cap members at **Basic**, **Standard**, or **Premium** to control which model and reasoning-effort combinations they can select. The setting applies to every model option in the selected tier, not only to the auto-model rows. Models and reasoning efforts above a member's ceiling are locked in the picker, and agents configured with an unpermitted option show an error instead of running.

  Open the information panel beside the model-tier setting to see the current model and reasoning-effort options in each tier. The list changes as Dust updates its model catalog, pricing, and availability.

  Available in every new credit-based workspace.
</Update>

<Update label="August 4th, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## Modjo MCP is now available

  The official Modjo MCP is now available in all Dust workspaces. Your agents can connect to Modjo to retrieve call transcripts, deal details, and other company information, then use that context in agent answers and workflows. Modjo combines call transcripts with CRM capabilities, so you can bring both conversation and revenue context into Dust. Available to all Dust users.
</Update>

<Update label="July 31st, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## Workspaces can now choose a skill’s availability

  You can now set a skill’s availability at the workspace level. Choose Editors only to limit discovery to editors while keeping the skill usable through agents and other skills, All members to make it available through the input bar and agent builder to everyone, or Members and agents to include agents with Discover Skills enabled. Admins and managers can control who changes this setting.
</Update>

<Update label="July 30th, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## Restrict a tool to skills

  Workspace admins can now restrict a tool so agents and conversations can use it only through a skill, rather than adding it directly. This adds a governance layer for tools that need workspace-specific query guidance or safety rules, helping prevent inefficient repeated calls and unsafe use. The setting is available to every workspace admin.
</Update>

<Update label="July 29th, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## Admin governance controls

  Dust now lets admins manage user groups and assign granular permissions across the workspace. You can create groups manually or provision them, control which groups can create or publish agents, manage public frame sharing, and use the new manager role as the builder role is deprecated.

  Available to everyone now.
</Update>

<Update label="July 27th, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## Kimi K3 via Fireworks AI

  You can now use Kimi K3 through Fireworks AI, bringing a strong open-weights model to Dust. It delivers quality close to Claude Fable and GPT 5.6 Sol, with a similar cost per task to GPT Sol.

  Available to everyone with access to US-based models.
</Update>

<Update label="July 22nd, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## Connect your personal Zendesk account

  You can now connect your own Zendesk account to the Zendesk tool, alongside the workspace connection. Actions run under your identity, so updates and replies are attributed to you instead of a shared workspace account.

  The subdomain comes from the workspace connection, so you only authenticate once. Open the Zendesk tool settings to connect your personal account. Available in all workspaces with Zendesk configured.
</Update>

<Update label="July 10th, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## Slack MCP Improvements: Reactions, Status Updates, and Optional "Sent by Agent" Footer

  🎯 What is it?

  Your agents can now do more when working through the Slack integration. They can add and remove emoji reactions, update Slack status, and, when an admin allows it, send messages without the "sent by agent" footer that normally appears with personal authentication.

  💡 Why is it useful?

  Until now, these were hard limitations of the Slack integration: agents couldn't react to messages, change status, or send messages that looked fully native. These additions let your agents interact in Slack in a more natural way, and give you finer control over how agent-sent messages appear to your teams.

  ⚙ How does it work?

  Reactions and status updates are available to everyone out of the box. The "sent by agent" footer can be turned off on a per-message basis, but only if an admin has enabled that option for your workspace, so you stay in control of transparency.

  ✨ Concrete Use Cases

  Here's how you could use it:

  * **Acknowledging messages**: An agent monitoring a support channel can add a ✅ reaction once it has picked up and handled a request, giving your team an instant visual cue.
  * **Signaling availability**: An agent can update a user's Slack status (for example, "In a meeting" or "Focusing") based on calendar events or workflow triggers.
  * **Cleaner notifications**: For internal broadcast messages where the footer adds noise, an admin-approved agent can post updates that read more naturally to recipients.

  📈 Benefits for you

  Agents feel more like real teammates inside Slack, interactions are smoother, and admins keep control over both transparency and how agent messages are presented.

  🚀 How to access it?

  Reactions and status updates are available now to everyone using the Slack integration, no setup needed. To allow users to remove the "sent by agent" footer, an admin needs to enable the corresponding toggle in your workspace settings first.
</Update>

<Update label="July 10th, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## GPT-5.6 Sol, Terra & Luna Are Now Available on Dust

  🎯 What is it?

  We've added OpenAI's newest GPT-5.6 model family to Dust. It comes in three tiers, each tuned for a different balance of speed, cost, and capability: **Sol** (the most capable), **Terra** (the balanced middle-ground), and **Luna** (the fastest). All three can be selected directly when building or editing an agent.

  💡 Why is it useful?

  Not every task needs the most powerful model, and not every task can afford to wait. Until now, choosing a model often meant trading off speed against depth of reasoning. With three clearly defined tiers, you can now match the right model to the right job, getting fast responses where you need throughput and deeper reasoning where the task demands it, without paying for more than you need.

  ⚙️ How does it work?

  Each tier is designed for a specific profile:

  * **Sol**: the most capable, built for complex, long-horizon agentic workflows.
  * **Terra**: strong reasoning at a reasonable cost, a solid default for most use cases.
  * **Luna**: optimized for high-throughput, low-latency tasks where speed matters most.

  📈 Benefits for you

  More control and flexibility: you can optimize each agent for speed, cost, or depth depending on its purpose, improving both efficiency and results across your workspace.

  🚀 How to access it?

  The three models are available to all users right now. Open the agent builder, go to the model picker, and select **Sol**, **Terra**, or **Luna** to start using them.
</Update>

<Update label="July 8th, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## 🔔 Sound Notification When an Agent Needs Your Approval

  🎯 What is it?

  Dust can now play a sound alert whenever one of your agents pauses and waits for you to approve or decline a tool action. The sound only plays when you're not actively viewing that particular conversation, so you're notified precisely when your attention is needed elsewhere.

  💡 Why is it useful?

  When an agent runs a task that requires manual approval (for example, before it performs a sensitive action), it pauses until you respond. If you've switched to another tab or you're working on something else, it was easy to miss these moments and leave an agent waiting. This audio alert ensures you can step away or multitask without losing track of pending approvals.

  ⚙️ How does it work?

  Once enabled, Dust plays your configured sound whenever an agent is waiting for approval or decline of a tool, and only if you're not currently looking at that conversation. Sound notifications are off by default, so you're fully in control of whether you use them.

  ✨ Concrete Use Cases

  Here's how you could use it:

  * **Multitasking across tabs**: You launch an agent on a long task, switch to your inbox, and get an audible cue the moment it needs your go-ahead, no need to keep checking back.
  * **Running several agents at once**: While monitoring multiple conversations, you're alerted as soon as any one of them pauses for approval, so none of them sit idle.

  📈 Benefits for you

  Less time spent checking on agents, faster response to approval requests, and smoother multitasking. Your agents spend less time waiting, which keeps your workflows moving.

  🚀 How to access it?

  Sound notifications are off by default. To turn them on, go to **Personal Settings → Notifications** and enable the sound alert (you can also configure which sound plays).
</Update>

<Update label="July 8th, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## Set Default Skills in Pods

  🎯 What is it?

  Pod editors can now select a set of default skills directly from their Pod settings. Once configured, these skills automatically appear in the input bar of every new conversation started in that Pod, exactly as if each user had added them manually via the "/" command or the dropdown menu.

  💡 Why is it useful?

  Until now, if you wanted to use skills that aren't attached to a specific agent, you had to add them by hand every time you started a new conversation. This created repetitive friction, especially for teams relying on the same set of skills day to day. Default skills remove that step, ensuring the right capabilities are always ready from the very first message.

  ⚙ How does it work?

  A Pod editor opens the Pod settings and selects the skills they want available by default. From that point on, every new conversation in the Pod automatically loads those skills into the input bar. Users can still add or remove skills per conversation as needed.

  ✨ Concrete Use Cases

  Here's how you could use it:

  * **Standardizing team workflows**: A Pod dedicated to customer support can have your knowledge-search and ticket-handling skills preloaded, so every agent starts with the same toolkit.
  * **User onboarding and activation**: Set helpful skills as defaults to guide new members and help them get value from the Pod immediately, without needing to know which skills to add.

  📈 Benefits for you

  You save time by eliminating repetitive setup, ensure consistency across conversations in a Pod, and make it easier for new users to get productive right away with the most relevant skills already in place.

  🚀 How to access it?

  This is available to all users. If you're a Pod editor, head to your Pod settings, select the skills you'd like to set as defaults, and they'll automatically appear in every new conversation started in that Pod.
</Update>

<Update label="July 6th, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## Select a Custom Default Agent in Pods

  🎯 What is it?

  You can now choose a default agent for an entire Pod. Once set by a Pod editor, every new conversation started in that Pod will automatically begin with the selected agent, instead of the standard default. This setting lives directly in your Pod settings.

  💡 Why is it useful?

  Teams often rely on a specific agent that already has the right context, skills, and connected data for their work. Until now, members had to manually pick that agent each time they started a conversation, an easy step to forget and a source of inconsistency across a team. Setting a default agent at the Pod level removes that friction and ensures everyone starts from the same, well-prepared assistant.

  ⚙️ How does it work?

  An editor of the Pod opens the Pod settings and selects the agent they want as the default. From that point on, all new conversations created in the Pod open with this agent already selected.

  ✨ Concrete Use Cases

  Here's how you could use it:

  * **Support team Pod**: Set a customer-support agent as the default so every new conversation is handled by an agent that already knows your product documentation and support tone.
  * **Sales team Pod**: Default to an agent connected to your CRM and sales playbooks, so account managers immediately get relevant, context-aware answers without any setup.

  📈 Benefits for you

  * Consistency across your team: everyone talks to the same specialized agent by default.
  * Time saved: no need to manually select the right agent for each new conversation.
  * Better answers from the start: conversations begin with the context, skills, and data your team actually needs.

  🚀 How to access it?

  This is available to all users. If you're an editor of a Pod, open your **Pod settings** and select the agent you'd like to set as the default for new conversations. Existing conversations are unaffected.
</Update>

<Update label="July 3rd, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## Triggers Now Run Inside Pods

  🎯 What is it?

  When a trigger fires, the conversation it creates now lives directly inside the Pod you've selected. This means every automated run lands in the right workspace context from the start, rather than sitting outside your team's organized spaces.

  💡 Why is it useful?

  Automated work can quickly become hard to track when it's scattered outside your team's normal environment. By routing triggered conversations into a Pod, everything stays organized, easy to find, and shareable with the right people, automatically placed where the relevant context already lives.

  ⚙️ How does it work?

  When you set up a trigger, you select the Pod where its conversations should run. From then on, each time the trigger fires, the resulting conversation is created inside that Pod alongside your team's related work.

  ✨ Concrete Use Cases

  Here's how you could use it:

  * **Recurring reporting**: A daily trigger that generates a summary now posts its conversation straight into your team's reporting Pod, where everyone already looks for updates.
  * **Automated monitoring**: A trigger watching for specific events creates its conversations inside the dedicated project Pod, so the whole team can review and act on them in context.

  📈 Benefits for you

  Less time spent hunting for automated runs, better visibility for your team, and cleaner organization of all triggered work: each conversation lands exactly where it belongs, with the right people able to access it.

  🚀 How to access it?

  This is available to all users. Open your trigger configuration and select the Pod where you'd like the triggered conversations to run.
</Update>

<Update label="June 30th, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## Claude Sonnet 5 is Now Available on Dust

  🎯 What is it?

  We've added Anthropic's latest model, Claude Sonnet 5, to Dust. The `claude-sonnet` global agent now runs on Sonnet 5 automatically, and you can also select Sonnet 5 directly when building your own agents.

  💡 Why is it useful?

  You get access to the newest generation of the Sonnet model, with its improvements in reasoning, quality, and overall performance, without having to change any of your existing setups. The upgrade happens automatically behind the global agent.

  ⚙ How does it work?

  The `claude-sonnet` global agent has been updated to point to Sonnet 5, so it's already using the new model. In the agent builder, Sonnet 5 now appears as an option in the model picker, ready to be assigned to any agent you create or edit.

  ✨ Concrete Use Cases

  Here's how you could use it:

  * **Upgrade an existing agent**: Edit one of your custom agents and switch its model to Sonnet 5 to benefit from the latest improvements.
  * **Quick everyday tasks**: Use the `claude-sonnet` global agent. It already runs on Sonnet 5, no configuration needed.

  📈 Benefits for you

  Access to a more capable model for your agents, improved output quality, and a smooth transition since your current configurations keep working as-is.

  🚀 How to access it?

  If your workspace is on a paid plan, Sonnet 5 is already available, no feature flag required. Use it through the `claude-sonnet` global agent, or select it in the model picker within the agent builder.

  ⚠ Please note: Sonnet 5 is not yet available for workspaces with EU data residency. We'll keep you informed as soon as that changes.
</Update>

<Update label="June 30th, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## Youtrust Remote MCP Server Now Available in Dust

  🎯 **What is it?**

  You can now connect your Dust workspace directly to Youtrust, an e-signature platform, through our Remote MCP Servers catalog. Once connected, your agents can search signature requests, use existing templates, and trigger signing flows, all without leaving Dust.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Managing contracts and signature requests often means juggling multiple tools and manual handoffs between drafting a document and getting it signed. This integration removes that friction by letting your agents interact with Youtrust on your behalf, so signature workflows can run end to end inside Dust.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  Youtrust is available as a Remote MCP Server, which is a secure way for Dust to connect to an external service. The connection uses standard, secure authentication (OAuth), so your agents can act on your Youtrust account safely once it's set up.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  * **Contract drafting and sending**: Have an agent draft a contract and send it for signature in one continuous flow, with no manual copy-paste or switching tools.
  * **Automated follow-ups**: Set up an agent to monitor pending signature requests and automatically follow up when a deadline is approaching, so nothing slips through the cracks.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  Less manual work, faster turnaround on signatures, and fewer forgotten follow-ups. Your team can spend less time chasing documents and more time on higher-value work.

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  If your team uses Youtrust, head to the Remote MCP Servers catalog in your Dust workspace, select Youtrust, and connect your account using the guided authentication flow. Once connected, the Youtrust capabilities can be added to your agents.

  ***

  *Note: this integration is available to anyone using Youtrust. If you'd like help setting up a specific use case, your Customer Success contact is happy to assist.*
</Update>

<Update label="June 30th, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## Agents Can Now Ask You Clarifying Questions: Available Everywhere

  🎯 **What is it?**

  The "Ask user question" capability is now built into every agent by default. This means any agent can pause mid-task to ask you a clarifying question when it needs more information, instead of guessing or proceeding with incomplete instructions. Previously, this had to be manually enabled on a per-agent basis.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Until now, this capability was opt-in, which made it hard to discover and easy to forget when building a custom agent. By making it a default for all agents, you get more reliable, conversational interactions out of the box: agents can check in with you before heading in the wrong direction.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  When an agent encounters ambiguity or needs a decision from you, it can now ask you directly during a task. You answer, and the agent continues with the right context. No setup or configuration is needed.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  * **Ambiguous requests**: You ask an agent to "draft the email to the client". Instead of assuming which client, it asks you to confirm before writing.
  * **Missing details**: An agent working on a report notices a required figure is missing and asks you for it, rather than leaving a gap or inventing a value.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  More accurate results, fewer back-and-forth corrections, and a smoother collaboration with your agents, especially for custom agents where this previously had to be configured manually.

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  There's nothing to set up. This is now active by default for all agents across your workspace, including any custom agents you've already built.
</Update>

<Update label="June 30th, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## The Computer: Let Your Agents Work Safely with Files, Code, and More

  🎯 What is it?

  The [Computer](/docs/user-documentation/agents/tools/computer) is a new capability that gives your agents access to an isolated, secure environment where they can work directly with files, run calculations, execute code and handle larger multi-step workflows. Optionally, you can authorize your Computer environment to make network requests to specific destinations.

  💡 Why is it useful?

  Until now, agents were limited when it came to tasks that required actually processing files, running code, or chaining together more complex operations. The Computer removes those limits by giving agents a safe, sandboxed space to get hands-on work done, so they can support richer and more demanding tasks end to end.

  ⚙️ How does it work?

  Agents operate inside an isolated environment where they can safely manipulate files, perform computations, run code, and connect to external resources. Because the environment is sandboxed, this work happens securely without affecting your other systems. This also adds support for most external agent skills.

  ✨ Concrete Use Cases

  Here's how you could use it:

  * **File processing**: Have an agent extract text from a PDF, clean up a spreadsheet, or convert and reorganize a set of documents.
  * **Calculations & data work**: Ask an agent to run numerical analysis or process a dataset and return the results.
  * **Code execution**: Let an agent write and run code to automate a task or test a quick script.
  * **Larger workflows**: Combine several steps, such as fetching data via a network request, transforming it, and producing a final output, in a single agent run.

  📈 Benefits for you

  More capable agents and more efficient workflows. Tasks that previously required manual effort or couldn't be handled at all can now be completed directly by your agents, with broader support for external agent skills.

  🚀 How to access it?

  The Computer is available to everyone, with one exception: Enterprise workspaces that were not part of the beta. If that's your case, you can opt in at any time, and every workspace will automatically receive the feature within the next 2 weeks. You can learn more in the [documentation](/docs/user-documentation/agents/tools/computer).
</Update>

<Update label="June 24th, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## Pods Now Apply Your AGENTS.md to Every Conversation

  🎯 What is it?

  Pod editors can now manage an `AGENTS.md` file directly from their Pod settings. Once set, Dust automatically adds its content to the system prompt of every conversation that happens within that Pod, so your guidelines and workflows are always in effect.

  💡 Why is it useful?

  Previously, keeping behavior consistent across multiple conversations often meant copy-pasting the same instructions over and over. This feature lets you define your Pod-level rules and workflows once, in a single place, and have them applied everywhere automatically, ensuring consistency across every run without the manual overhead.

  ⚙ How does it work?

  Editors update the `AGENTS.md` file from the Pod settings, and Dust injects it into the system prompt for all conversations in that Pod. Oversized files are now handled more safely, so large instruction sets won't cause issues.

  ✨ Concrete Use Cases

  Here's how you could use it:

  * **Consistent tone and formatting**: Define how agents should respond (language, style, structure) so every conversation in the Pod follows the same standards.
  * **Shared workflows and guardrails**: Document the steps, do's and don'ts, or compliance rules your team must follow, and have them automatically enforced in each conversation.

  📈 Benefits for you

  You save time by setting your rules once instead of repeating them, you reduce the risk of inconsistent behavior across conversations, and you gain a single, easy-to-maintain source of truth for how your Pod should operate.

  🚀 How to access it?

  This is available to all Pod users for Pod conversations, no feature flag required. Pod editors can open their Pod settings and edit the `AGENTS.md` file to get started.
</Update>

<Update label="June 17th, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## Adomik Integration: Ad Revenue Analytics & Knowledge, Directly in Dust

  🎯 What is it?

  Adomik is now available as a default integration in Dust, connected securely via OAuth. Once enabled, your builders can give agents read-only access to Adomik's tools, allowing them to analyze your programmatic advertising and monetization data, as well as search and retrieve pages from your Adomik knowledge base, all without leaving Dust.

  💡 Why is it useful?

  If your teams work with programmatic advertising, investigating revenue movements or pricing shifts often means jumping between tools and manually pulling reports. This integration brings that data and knowledge directly into your agents, so you can run monetization investigations and draft analyses in one place.

  ⚙️ How does it work?

  Adomik connects as a remote integration through a secure OAuth login. The tools are strictly read-only, meaning agents can analyze and retrieve your data but cannot modify anything on the Adomik side.

  ✨ Concrete Use Cases

  Here's how you could use it:

  * **Revenue investigation**: Ask an agent to identify and explain sudden CPC/CPM shifts or revenue movements across your programmatic inventory.
  * **Report drafting**: Have an agent pull the relevant monetization figures and draft a first version of a performance report for your team.
  * **Knowledge lookup**: Let an agent search your Adomik knowledge base to quickly answer process or methodology questions.

  📈 Benefits for you

  You save time by consolidating ad data analysis and knowledge retrieval into your existing Dust agents, reduce manual back-and-forth between platforms, and give your teams faster, data-backed answers on monetization questions.

  🚀 How to access it?

  An admin first connects Adomik from **Spaces → Tools**. Once connected, your builders can add the Adomik tools to any relevant agent.
</Update>

<Update label="June 17th, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## Lemlist MCP Server Now Available

  🎯 **What is it?**

  The Lemlist MCP Server is now available across all Dust workspaces. It connects your Dust agents directly to Lemlist, giving them access to your leads, verified contacts, and multichannel outreach sequences. In short, your agents can now help you manage your outbound workflow without you having to switch tools.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Outbound prospecting often means juggling several tools and repeating the same manual steps: pulling lead lists, checking contact details, updating sequences. By bringing Lemlist into Dust, you can hand those tasks to an agent and keep your focus on strategy and conversations that matter.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  Once enabled, an agent can query and act on your Lemlist data through the connection: retrieving leads, accessing verified contact information, and working with your multichannel sequences. You ask the agent in natural language, and it interacts with Lemlist on your behalf.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  * **Lead review:** Ask an agent to pull a list of leads from a given Lemlist campaign and summarize who's worth prioritizing.
  * **Contact enrichment:** Have an agent retrieve verified contact details for a set of prospects before you reach out.
  * **Sequence management:** Ask an agent to check the status of your multichannel sequences or help you organize prospects across channels.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  Less tool-switching, faster access to your outbound data, and the ability to delegate repetitive prospecting tasks to an agent. The result is a smoother outbound workflow and more time for high-value selling.

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  The Lemlist MCP Server is available in all Dust workspaces. You can add it as a tool when building or editing an agent, then connect your Lemlist account to start using it. If you're a Lemlist user, it's ready for you to set up today.

  ## GLM 5.2 Now Available in Dust

  🎯 What is it?

  GLM 5.2 is a new AI model developed by the lab Z.ai, now available within Dust. It performs at a frontier level on many agentic benchmarks, with results comparable to leading models like Opus 4.8 and GPT 5.5. The model is hosted in the United States by Fireworks.

  💡 Why is it useful?

  Having access to a broad range of high-performing models means you're never locked into a single provider. GLM 5.2 expands your options with a model that delivers top-tier performance on agentic tasks, giving you more flexibility to choose the right model for your specific needs and use cases.

  ⚙️ How does it work?

  GLM 5.2 is available as a model option when building or configuring your agents. You select it from the list of available models, just as you would with any other supported model. Although developed by Z.ai, it is hosted in the US by Fireworks.

  ✨ Concrete Use Cases

  Here's how you could use it:

  * **Agentic workflows**: Power agents that handle multi-step tasks and tool use, where GLM 5.2's strong agentic benchmark performance shines.

  ## Email Threads Now Stay in a Single Conversation

  📌 Context

  When you interact with a Dust agent over email, each reply used to start a brand-new Dust conversation. So if an agent answered your email and you replied back, that reply was treated as a separate, disconnected conversation, losing the continuity of the exchange.

  We've changed this behavior: an email thread now maps to a single Dust conversation. Every reply within the same email thread continues in the same conversation, preserving the full context of the discussion. This change was driven both by product best practices and by popular demand from users.

  🔄 Impact on Dust

  Dust now recognizes when an incoming email belongs to an existing thread and routes it to the matching conversation automatically. The agent keeps the full history of the exchange in context, so each reply builds on what came before rather than starting from scratch.

  👤 Impact for you

  This is a positive change with no downside. When you email back and forth with an agent, the conversation stays coherent: the agent remembers the earlier messages in the thread, giving you more relevant and context-aware responses. You no longer end up with a scattered set of one-off conversations for what is really a single discussion.

  ✅ Actions required

  No action required on your part. The improvement is live and applies to everyone automatically. Just reply within the same email thread as usual, and the conversation will continue where it left off.

  ## Clari Copilot Integration Now Available for All Workspaces

  🎯 What is it?

  Your agents can now connect directly to Clari Copilot to search and analyze your sales calls. Without leaving Dust, an agent can pull up call transcripts, AI-generated summaries, discussed topics, action items, and competitor mentions. You can also filter calls by attendee email to zero in on specific conversations.

  💡 Why is it useful?

  Sales call intelligence usually lives in a separate tool, which means manually exporting or copy/pasting transcripts whenever you want to act on them. This integration removes that friction: the insights captured in your calls become directly usable inside your Dust workflows, so nothing gets lost between the conversation and the follow-up.

  ⚙️ How does it work?

  Dust connects to Clari Copilot through a dedicated integration secured with your Clari API credentials. Once connected, your agents can query call data on demand, just like they would search any other connected source.

  ✨ Concrete Use Cases

  Here's how you could use it:

  * **Account recaps**: Ask an agent to summarize all recent calls with a given account before a renewal conversation or QBR.
  * **Sales-to-CS handoffs**: Generate a clean handoff brief from the latest sales calls, including action items and key topics, so Customer Success starts fully informed.
  * **Meeting follow-ups**: Draft follow-up emails based on what was actually said and committed to during a call.
  * **Voice of Customer analysis**: Surface recurring themes and competitor mentions across calls to feed product and go-to-market decisions.

  📈 Benefits for you

  Less manual exporting and copy/pasting, faster and more accurate follow-ups, and smoother handoffs between teams. Your call data stops being a static archive and becomes something your agents can act on in real time.

  🚀 How to access it?

  The integration is now generally available to all workspaces. To set it up, add the Clari Copilot MCP server in your workspace tools and configure it with your Clari `X-Api-Key` and `X-Api-Password`. Once connected, you can add the Clari Copilot tools to any agent. Reach out to us if you'd like a hand getting it configured.

  ## Dust is now a remote MCP server

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Dust can now be connected to any MCP-capable client as a remote MCP server. This means you can access your Dust building blocks (workspace knowledge, Pods, conversations, and files) directly from the other tools you already use, without having to open Dust itself.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Until now, reusing your Dust knowledge and artifacts in another tool often meant copy/pasting content back and forth or constantly switching between apps. By making Dust available as a remote MCP server, your trusted context travels with you, so the same knowledge and outputs can be tapped into wherever you work.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standard way for applications to securely connect to external sources of context. Any client that supports MCP can now authenticate to Dust and pull in your building blocks on demand. Full setup instructions are available in the [documentation](/docs/user-documentation/agents/integrations/dust-mcp-server).

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  * **Working in an MCP-capable coding or writing tool:** Pull in relevant workspace knowledge or a past conversation directly into your working environment, without leaving the app you're in.
  * **Reusing existing artifacts:** Reference files or Pod content from Dust inside another client, so your team relies on a single, trusted source instead of duplicated copies.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  Less copy/pasting, fewer app switches, and more consistency. Your teams can reuse the same trusted knowledge and artifacts across tools, which saves time and reduces the risk of working from outdated or fragmented information.

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  This is available now to everyone, no feature flag required. To get started, follow the connection steps in the [documentation](/docs/user-documentation/agents/integrations/dust-mcp-server).

  A note for workspace admins: you stay in control of access. You can disable MCP server access for the entire workspace, and you can restrict which redirect URIs are allowed during client authentication.

  ## Gamma MCP now available in Dust

  🎯 What is it?

  You can now connect Gamma to Dust as a Remote MCP Server. Once connected, your Dust agents can interact directly with Gamma to create and manage AI-powered presentations and documents from within your conversations.

  💡 Why is it useful?

  Creating presentations usually means switching between tools: drafting content in one place, then manually building slides in another. With the Gamma integration, your agents can handle the full process in one flow, from generating the content to producing a polished presentation, without you leaving Dust.

  ⚙️ How does it work?

  Gamma connects as a Remote MCP Server via OAuth. Once an admin sets it up in Spaces → Tools, the Gamma capabilities become available to any agent in the workspace.

  ✨ Concrete Use Cases

  * **One-click presentations**: Ask an agent to turn a brief or a set of notes into a ready-to-share Gamma presentation.
  * **Document generation**: Generate polished Gamma documents directly from your Dust conversations, without copy-pasting.

  📈 Benefits for you

  Faster content creation, fewer tool switches, and the ability to produce professional presentations and documents as part of any agent workflow.

  🚀 How to access it?

  Go to **Spaces → Tools** and add Gamma as a Remote MCP Server. Once connected, add the Gamma tools to any of your agents.

  ## Skills in Skills: Compose Skills and Tools Directly Within Your Instructions

  ## 🎯 What is it?

  You can now reference skills and tools directly inside your skill instructions, the same way you already reference knowledge. Skills can call on other skills, letting you build richer, more modular capabilities by combining existing building blocks. As part of this change, the separate "tools" section has been removed, and tools are now inserted inline wherever you need them.

  ## 💡 Why is it useful?

  Until now, skills stood on their own and couldn't draw on one another, which often meant duplicating the same logic across multiple skills. This update responds to a widely requested ability to compose skills, so you can assemble specialized capabilities into more complete workflows without rebuilding them each time.

  ## ⚙️ How does it work?

  When editing a skill's instructions, you use a dropdown to insert a reference to another skill or to a tool inline, exactly as you would when adding knowledge. The referenced skill or tool becomes part of that skill's behavior, so capabilities can be layered and reused.

  ## ✨ Concrete Use Cases

  Here's how you could use it:

  * **Building on existing skills**: Create a "Weekly Report" skill that references your existing "Data Retrieval" and "Summarization" skills, rather than duplicating that logic.
  * **Inline tool placement**: Insert a specific tool exactly at the point in your instructions where it's needed, making the skill's behavior clearer and easier to maintain.

  ## 📈 Benefits for you

  Less duplication, easier maintenance, and far more flexibility when designing skills. By composing skills from smaller, reusable pieces, you can build sophisticated agents faster and keep them consistent over time.

  ## 🚀 How to access it?

  The feature is available to everyone. When editing a skill, use the dropdown within the instructions to insert a reference to another skill or a tool. Your existing skills have already been updated automatically: the list of tools previously associated with a skill now appears at the top of its instructions, so nothing is lost in the transition.

  ***

  *No action is required on your part, your existing skills continue to work as before. This is simply a new way to compose and reuse them going forward.*

  ## Dust Support: Get Instant, Grounded Support Answers from @dust

  🎯 **What is it?**

  We've introduced a new discoverable skill that turns @dust into your first line of support. When you ask a support-related question, the agent detects your intent, answers it directly, and grounds its response in trusted sources so you can rely on what it tells you.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Until now, getting a support answer often meant leaving your workspace to search documentation, browse community threads, or file a request and wait. This skill brings accurate support answers to you instantly, right where you already work, so you spend less time hunting for help and more time getting things done.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  The skill recognizes when you're asking a support question and responds with answers grounded in real, up-to-date sources: the public [dust-tt/dust GitHub issues](https://github.com/dust-tt/dust/issues) and the [Dust community](https://community.dust.tt). This means responses reflect documented known issues and community knowledge rather than guesswork.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  * **Troubleshooting a behavior**: Ask "Why is my agent not picking up the latest documents from my connected data source?" and get an answer grounded in known issues and community discussions.
  * **Checking a known issue**: Ask "Is there a reported problem with PDF parsing right now?" and find out whether it's a documented issue with a workaround or fix already discussed.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  Faster, more accurate answers without leaving Dust. You get reliable support grounded in real sources, reduce the back-and-forth of opening tickets, and resolve questions in the flow of your work.

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  The skill is discoverable and available to every user. Mention @dust and ask your support question. The agent will detect that you need support and respond with a grounded answer.

  ## Speech-to-Text for Audio & Video Files

  🎯 What is it?

  A new speech-to-text tool is now available in Dust, allowing your agents to transcribe spoken content from both audio and video sources. You can transcribe content from supported URLs or by uploading files directly, with support for most common formats (mp3, mp4, wav, m4a, mov, webm, aac, flac, and more).

  💡 Why is it useful?

  Audio and video content is everywhere (meeting recordings, interviews, webinars, voice notes), but the information locked inside it is hard to search, reuse, or act on. Transcription has been a recurring request, and with Dust's expanded processing capabilities, your agents can now turn spoken content into text that can be summarized, analyzed, and integrated into your workflows.

  ⚙️ How does it work?

  Your agent can transcribe content in two ways: from a URL (within an approved list of domains) or from a file you upload directly. Once transcribed, the text becomes available for the agent to work with: summarizing, extracting key points, or feeding into other tasks.

  ✨ Concrete Use Cases

  Here's how you could use it:

  * **Meeting follow-ups**: Upload a recording of a call and ask your agent to produce a clean summary with action items and decisions.
  * **Content repurposing**: Transcribe a webinar or podcast episode, then have your agent draft a blog post, social snippets, or an internal recap.
  * **Interview analysis**: Turn recorded user interviews into searchable text and extract recurring themes or quotes.

  📈 Benefits for you

  Significant time savings on manual transcription, easier reuse of audio/video content, and the ability to make spoken information searchable and actionable, all within your existing Dust workflows.

  🚀 How to access it?

  The feature is available to everyone now, no activation needed. Provide a supported URL or upload an audio/video file in your conversation, and ask your agent to transcribe it.
</Update>

  ## Pods: A Shared Workspace for Your Team and Your Agents

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Pods are dedicated collaborative spaces where your team and your agents work together on a shared initiative. Each Pod brings **Conversations**, **Files**, and **Tasks** into one place, continuously indexed so that agents build on what was already discussed, without you having to re-explain context every time.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Work in most teams is fragmented: conversations are scattered across individual feeds, files live in different tools, and every new interaction starts from scratch. Pods solve this by making context persistent and shared, so the next conversation starts smarter than the last, and nothing gets lost between sessions.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  When you create a Pod, you get a shared environment with four core components:

  * **Conversations**: All threads related to the initiative stay in one place, and are continuously indexed so agents can reference past decisions automatically.
  * **Files**: Upload documents or connect Company Data directly into the Pod. Everyone, humans and agents alike, works from the same shared context.
  * **Tasks**: Create to-dos, assign them to teammates, or launch agent-run task conversations with the right context preloaded.
  * **Governance**: Pods can be **open** (anyone in the workspace can join) or **invite-only** (editors manage membership).

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  **Running a client project**: Create a Pod for the account, add the relevant files and data sources, and let your agents reuse every past decision and conversation thread. No more copy-pasting context into each new chat.

  **Managing a recurring initiative**: Use Tasks to assign work to teammates or trigger agent-run conversations at the right moment, with all the background knowledge already loaded in the Pod.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **No more context re-pasting**: agents remember what was discussed and build on it automatically.
  * **One place for everything**: files, conversations, and tasks are co-located and shared across your team.
  * **Agents as true teammates**: they can read files, reference past conversations, create and update tasks, and manage Pod members.
  * **Flexible permissions**: open collaboration or controlled access, depending on what your initiative requires.

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  Pods are available to **everyone**: no feature flag, no opt-in required. Look for the **Pods** section in your Dust sidebar. Documentation is at [/docs/user-documentation/pods/overview](/docs/user-documentation/pods/overview).

  ## Claude Opus 4.8 Now Available in the Agent Builder

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Claude Opus 4.8, Anthropic's latest and most advanced reasoning model, is now available in Dust's agent builder. Enterprise customers can select it as the underlying model when creating custom agents, giving them access to Anthropic's most capable model to date.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Opus models sit at the top of Anthropic's model family: they're designed for tasks that demand deep reasoning, sustained multi-step thinking, and the highest quality outputs. Opus 4.8 is no exception, and it's now within reach directly from your Dust workspace.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  When building or editing a custom agent in Dust, you can now select **Claude Opus 4.8** as the model powering that agent. The model is not set as a default. It's a deliberate choice available to those who want the highest level of reasoning for specific, demanding use cases.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  * **Complex analysis & synthesis**: Build an agent that processes lengthy, nuanced documents (legal contracts, research reports, financial filings) and produces high-quality structured summaries or recommendations.
  * **Advanced code generation & review**: Set up a coding agent that not only generates code but critically evaluates logic, identifies edge cases, and suggests architectural improvements across long codebases.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  Access to Opus 4.8 means your most demanding workflows no longer require trade-offs between speed and quality: you can configure dedicated agents that bring the best reasoning available to bear on your hardest problems, while keeping lighter models for everyday tasks.

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  This feature is available to **Enterprise customers**. Go to the **Agent Builder**, create or edit a custom agent, and choose **Claude Opus 4.8** in the model selection step.

  ## [Apify MCP Is Now Available in Dust](https://apify.com/store/categories/mcp-servers)

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Dust agents can now connect to Apify as a remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. This means your agents can trigger Apify Actors (pre-built web scraping and automation tools) directly from a Dust conversation, and pull the resulting data back in real time.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Getting fresh data from the web or automating repetitive data-collection workflows has historically required custom-built scrapers, dedicated infrastructure, or manual copy-paste work. With Apify connected to Dust, agents can tap into thousands of ready-made scraping and automation tools on demand: no custom code, no glue scripts, no maintenance overhead.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  Apify is connected as a remote MCP server inside Dust. Once set up, agents can call any Apify Actor (a self-contained unit for scraping or automating tasks on a specific platform or website), wait for it to run, and fetch the structured output directly into the conversation. Authentication is handled via OAuth.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  * **Competitive intelligence**: Ask an agent to scrape a competitor's pricing page or product listings on a weekly basis and summarize changes, no manual browsing required.
  * **Lead enrichment**: Trigger an Apify Actor to pull public company data, LinkedIn profiles, or job postings and feed the results directly into your CRM workflow through Dust.
  * **Social media monitoring**: Run an Actor to collect recent posts or mentions from a specific platform and have an agent analyze sentiment or flag trending topics.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  Access to live, structured web data without engineering effort. Your agents become significantly more autonomous on research, monitoring, and data-gathering tasks, eliminating the round-trip between Dust and external scraping tools.

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  Dust just added six new MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrations: **Monday.com**, **Snowflake**, **Luma**, **Confluence**, **Contentsquare**, and **Praiz** are now available for all workspaces. Each integration lets your agents connect directly to these tools and take action: no tab-switching, no copy-pasting, no manual data gathering.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Your tools hold critical data: project statuses, warehouse queries, event records, meeting transcripts, wiki pages, digital experience metrics. Until now, getting that data into a Dust workflow meant leaving the conversation. With MCP integrations, agents can reach directly into these tools and surface exactly what you need, right where you're working.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  Each integration is set up once by an admin in **Spaces → Tools**. After that, any team member can add the tool to their agents. Authentication is handled via OAuth: secure, and no API key management required.

Praiz is a meeting intelligence platform that records, transcribes, and analyzes your calls using AI, and you can now connect it directly to your Dust workspace. Once connected, your Dust agents can search meetings and retrieve full transcripts along with rich metadata: timelines, participant details, comments, templates, and usage statistics.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Sales calls, customer success check-ins, and product interviews hold valuable insights, but those insights are usually locked inside recordings that no one goes back to read. With the Praiz integration, your Dust agents can tap into that conversation data on-demand, without you having to switch tools, copy-paste transcripts, or manually dig through recordings.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  Connect Praiz as a remote MCP server via OAuth in your Dust workspace. Once authenticated, any Dust agent you configure will be able to search your Praiz meetings and pull structured data from them (transcripts, timelines, participants, and more) directly within a Dust conversation or workflow.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Until now, Dust could connect to Confluence as a read-only data source, syncing pages so agents could search them. With the MCP Server, agents go further: they can now act on Confluence in real time. Agents can fetch the latest version of a page, pull a comment thread, or draft and publish new content, becoming active contributors to your knowledge base, not just readers.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  Once a workspace admin connects Confluence via **Spaces > Tools**, the integration becomes available to all members. Anyone can then add the Confluence tool to their agents. From there, agents can call Confluence directly during conversations: searching pages, reading history, creating or updating content, and leaving inline comments.

  ## Snowflake MCP Server: Now Generally Available

  🎯 **What is it?**

  The Snowflake MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server is now available to all Dust workspaces. Your agents can connect directly to Snowflake and interact with your data (listing databases, schemas, and tables, running SQL queries, inspecting column definitions, and retrieving results), all within a conversation.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Until now, getting insights from Snowflake required switching between tools, writing queries manually, or relying on data teams. With this integration, your agents can query your Snowflake data warehouse on the fly, turning natural language questions into structured data results without ever leaving Dust.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  Once configured by an admin, the Snowflake MCP Server is available as a tool that any agent can use. Ask your agent a data-related question, and it will query Snowflake, retrieve the relevant results, and surface them directly in the conversation.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  * **Sales reporting**: Ask your agent "What were our top 10 accounts by revenue last quarter?" and it queries Snowflake and returns the answer instantly.
  * **Data exploration**: Ask "What tables are available in our analytics schema?" to understand what data exists before diving deeper.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * Faster access to data insights without switching tools
  * No SQL expertise required for end users
  * Enables data-driven conversations directly in Dust

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  Admins can set up the Snowflake MCP Server in **Spaces → Tools**. Once configured, it becomes available for any agent in your workspace.

  ## Contentsquare Remote MCP Now Available in Dust

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Dust now integrates Contentsquare as a remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, available directly in the Dust tool catalog. Your agents can now query Contentsquare data (site metrics, funnels, user journeys, page comparisons, errors, and conversion impact) straight from a Dust conversation, without ever leaving the platform.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Analyzing digital experience data typically means logging into Contentsquare, navigating multiple dashboards, cross-referencing views, and manually synthesizing insights. This integration collapses that process into a simple conversational workflow: ask a question, get the answer, decide what to do next.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  Once an admin connects Contentsquare via OAuth in **Spaces > Tools**, the MCP server becomes available as a tool for agents in your workspace. Any agent equipped with this tool can then query Contentsquare's key DEX (Digital Experience) signals in real time.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  * **Conversion investigation**: Ask "Which steps in the checkout funnel had the highest drop-off last week?" and get an instant answer.
  * **Error impact analysis**: Ask "What is the conversion impact of the JavaScript errors on our homepage?" and get a business impact summary.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  Turn hours of manual dashboard exploration into a fast, natural-language Q\&A workflow. Anyone, not just analytics experts, can access Contentsquare insights through their agents.

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  1. Go to **Spaces > Tools** in your Dust workspace
  2. Find Contentsquare in the MCP catalog
  3. Connect via **OAuth** (admin rights required)
  4. Add the tool to any agent

  ## Collapsing Input Bar on Mobile for Better Reading

  🎯 **What is it?**

  On mobile, the input bar now automatically collapses into a compact pill as you scroll through a conversation. Voice input remains always visible and accessible, so you can interact with your agents without typing a single character.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Mobile screens are limited in space. When you're reading through a conversation, the input bar used to take up valuable vertical real estate. This update lets you focus on the content while keeping voice input just a thumb-tap away, making the mobile experience genuinely hands-free.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  As you scroll down in a conversation on mobile, the input bar shrinks into a small pill: unobtrusive, but always present. The voice input button remains accessible at all times. When you're ready to respond, just tap the pill to expand it back to full size, or go straight to voice.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  * **Reading long conversations on the go**: Scroll through a lengthy thread without the input bar eating into your screen, then jump straight into a voice reply when you're ready.
  * **Hands-free interaction**: Commuting or multitasking? Trigger voice input instantly from any point in the conversation without scrolling back to the bottom.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  More readable conversations on mobile, a more natural scrolling experience, and frictionless access to voice input, all without any setup. This is a step toward a fully no-typing mobile experience with Dust.

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  ## Agents Can Now Export Frames as PDF or PNG

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Agents can now export any Frame (the interactive visualizations and dashboards they generate) directly as a PDF or PNG file. This means any visual output produced during a conversation can be saved and shared in a universally accessible format.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Until now, Frames were only viewable inside a Dust conversation. If you wanted to share a report or dashboard with someone outside of Dust, you had to rely on screenshots or manual exports. This feature closes that gap and makes it easier to bring Dust's outputs into your broader workflows.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  When an agent generates a Frame in a conversation, it can now trigger an export directly, producing a clean, ready-to-share PDF or PNG file. Agents can also use this capability to inspect and reason about the visual output they just created, enabling smarter, more iterative work.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  * **Sharing a report with stakeholders**: Ask an agent to build a weekly performance dashboard as a Frame, then export it as a PDF to include in an email or slide deck.
  * **Automated document generation**: Have an agent create a formatted visual summary, export it as a PNG, and attach it directly to a Notion page or Slack message.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * Save time by eliminating manual export steps
  * Share polished, professional visuals directly from your conversations
  * Enable agents to work more autonomously by reasoning on their own visual outputs

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  This is available to everyone, right now. Ask an agent to build a Frame and request an export. The agent will handle the rest.
</Update>

  ## Inline Text Editing in Frames: Tweak Your Content Without Reprompting

  🎯 **What is it?**

  You can now double-click any static text inside a Frame to edit it directly, without having to reprompt the agent. Previously, correcting a word, tweaking a label, or adjusting any text in a Frame required going back to the conversation and asking the agent to make the change. Now you can just click and type.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Frames are designed to produce polished, ready-to-use outputs: documents, tables, dashboards, reports. But a great first draft rarely needs zero edits. Being able to fix text in place, without re-running the agent, makes the editing loop faster and puts you in control of the final result.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  When viewing a Frame in a conversation, any static text element can now be double-clicked to enter edit mode. You can type your changes and they apply immediately, just like editing a document.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  * **Quick copy fixes**: You asked for a report summary but the agent used slightly off-brand wording. Double-click and correct it in seconds.
  * **Number tweaks**: The agent drafted a slide with a placeholder figure. You have the real number now. Just double-click and type it in.
  * **Label adjustments**: A chart label or table header doesn't quite fit. Edit it directly without re-running anything.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  Fewer roundtrips to the agent for small edits, faster time from first draft to final output, and more direct control over the content you share.

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  This is available to everyone, now. Open any Frame in a conversation and double-click on a text element to start editing.

  ## LLM Model Refresh: Grok 4.3 Upgrade and Anthropic Model Migrations

  📌 **Context**

  Two of our LLM providers are making changes to their model lineups, and this affects the models available in Dust. Here’s what’s changing and when.

  **Grok 4.3 upgrade (happening now)**: xAI has deprecated Grok 3 and replaced it with Grok 4.3, at the same price point but with significantly better performance. This upgrade is live now. If you were using Grok 3, your agents will automatically switch to Grok 4.3, no action needed.

  **Anthropic model migrations (deadline: July 31, 2025)**: Anthropic is deprecating older Claude models. Here’s the mapping of legacy models to their recommended replacements:

  | Legacy model               | Replacement       |
  | -------------------------- | ----------------- |
  | claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620 | claude-sonnet-4-5 |
  | claude-3-5-haiku-20241022  | claude-haiku-4-5  |
  | claude-3-opus-20240229     | claude-opus-4-5   |
  | claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 | claude-sonnet-4-5 |

  **Deadline: July 31, 2025.** After that date, Anthropic will stop serving these legacy models.

  🔄 **Impact on Dust**

  Dust’s pre-built "global" agents (like @claude-sonnet) already run on the latest models and are unaffected. The risk is **only for custom agents** that were manually configured to use a specific legacy model ID.

  👤 **Impact for you**

  If you or your team have built custom agents on one of the legacy Anthropic models listed above, **those agents will stop working after July 31, 2025**. Check your custom agents and switch them to a supported model before the deadline.

  ✅ **Actions required**

  Review your custom agents before July 31. You can do this from the **Agent Builder** in Dust: go to your agent list, open any custom agent, and check the model it’s configured to use. If it’s one of the deprecated models, update it to the recommended replacement.

  Needs to be done by **July 31, 2025**.

  ## Branching Conversations

  🎯 **What is it?**

  You can now create a "branch" from any existing conversation. This creates a new conversation that inherits key context from the original (like a summary of what happened, attachments, and tool outputs) without carrying over the full message history.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  As conversations evolve, you often reach a point where you need to split work into parallel streams or share results without exposing all the back-and-forth. Branching lets you divide complex projects into focused workstreams, or collaborate on outcomes while keeping the messy details contained.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  Access the conversation menu (top right of the screen or next to the conversation title in the left sidebar) and select the branching option. The new conversation is created in 10-20 seconds with a compacted summary of the original conversation, plus copies of any attachments and tool outputs. The branch inherits the same access permissions as the original conversation at the time of creation.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Split a project into parallel workstreams**: Your conversation outlines a plan for building a new feature with three components. Branch into three separate conversations (one for each technical design) so teams can work independently without cluttering a single thread.

  **Share results, not process**: You've built a detailed data frame after hours of iteration and refinement. Branch the conversation so collaborators can access the final output and continue refining it, without wading through all the trial and error.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Better organization**: Keep complex projects manageable by splitting them into focused conversations
  * **Cleaner collaboration**: Share outcomes and context without overwhelming teammates with unnecessary details
  * **Flexible workflows**: Move from planning to execution across multiple parallel efforts

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  Look for the conversation menu in the top right corner of your screen, or next to the conversation title in your left sidebar. The branching option is available to everyone. Try it on your next multi-part project!

  ## Asana MCP update

  📌 Context

  Asana has shut down their MCP (Model Context Protocol) V1 server and migrated to V2. The old connection will stop working. If your workspace uses the Asana MCP tool in Dust, this is an action required update.

  🔄 Impact on Dust

  Dust has updated the Asana integration to support the V2 API. The new connection is fully compatible and ready to use.

  👤 Impact for you

  If your workspace currently uses the Asana MCP tool, the existing connection will break once Asana fully switches off V1. You’ll need to reconnect Asana using the new V2 setup.

  ✅ Actions required

  1. Go to **Spaces → Tools** in your Dust workspace
  2. Find the Asana MCP connection
  3. Reconnect it following the updated setup instructions

  This only affects workspaces that currently have Asana connected via MCP. If you haven’t set up the Asana integration yet, you can follow the new V2 instructions when you do.

  ## 🔒 Audit Logs for Enterprise Workspaces

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Enterprise workspace administrators now have access to detailed audit logs directly in the admin panel. These logs track all agent executions, tool calls, and administrative actions across your workspace. Additionally, you can stream these logs in real-time to your existing Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms like Datadog, Splunk, or any custom HTTPS endpoint.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Security and compliance teams need complete visibility into workspace activities for several critical purposes: responding to security incidents, meeting regulatory compliance requirements, conducting internal audits, and distinguishing between actions taken by users versus those performed by agents. Until now, this level of detailed activity tracking wasn't available in Dust.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  Audit logs are accessible through your admin panel with real-time updates. You can view the complete history of activities, filter by type (agent executions, tool calls, admin actions), and configure streaming to your preferred SIEM platform or custom endpoint for centralized security monitoring.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Security Incident Investigation**: When investigating a potential security event, quickly review which agents were executed, what tools they used, and which users or agents performed specific actions during the relevant timeframe.

  **Compliance Reporting**: Generate audit reports for compliance certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR) by exporting complete activity logs showing data access patterns, administrative changes, and agent behaviors.

  **Separation of Concerns**: Clearly distinguish between actions initiated by human users and those performed autonomously by agents, helping you understand and control automated workflows in your environment.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Stronger Security Posture**: Complete visibility into all workspace activities enables faster threat detection and incident response
  * **Simplified Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements with complete, exportable audit trails
  * **Operational Intelligence**: Understand how agents and users interact with your Dust workspace to optimize workflows
  * **Centralized Monitoring**: Integrate with your existing security infrastructure for unified monitoring across all enterprise tools

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  This feature is available exclusively for Enterprise plan workspaces. Workspace administrators can access audit logs by navigating to the admin panel.

  ## Agents can now see images returned by MCP tools

  🎯 **What is it?**

  We've shipped a new file system for conversations. The first thing it enables: agents can now see images returned by MCP tools. When a tool produces an image (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP), the agent receives the actual visual content and can interpret, analyze, and describe it.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Until now, when an MCP tool returned an image, agents were blind to it. They could acknowledge the file existed but couldn't look at it. This was a real gap: screenshots from Microsoft Drive, charts from data tools, visual outputs from external integrations, all invisible to the agent. That's now fixed.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  Behind the scenes, all conversation files are now organized in a unified, structured system. When an agent needs to access an image returned by an MCP tool, it receives the actual visual content instead of just metadata.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Screenshot analysis**: Have an agent interpret a screenshot returned by a Drive or browser tool, without manually describing what's on screen.

  **Chart and graph reading:** Ask an agent to extract trends or key metrics from a chart generated by a data tool.

  **Visual tool output review:** Any MCP tool that produces images can now have its output directly analyzed by the agent in context.

  ## Context Compaction: Keep Your Agents Sharp in Long Conversations

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Context Compaction is a new feature that automatically summarizes earlier parts of long conversations with your agents. Instead of losing context or hitting limits, Dust intelligently condenses the conversation history while preserving the essential information your agent needs to continue working effectively.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  During extended work sessions (like analyzing complex documents, iterating on code, or working through multi-step projects), conversations can become very long. Previously, this could degrade agent performance or force you to start a new conversation and lose your working context. Context Compaction solves this by maintaining quality throughout long interactions while keeping your full conversational context available in summarized form.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  A new usage indicator appears in your input bar showing how much context is being used. The system guides you through three stages: at 30% usage, compaction becomes available; at 70%, you'll see a helpful reminder to compact; and at 80%, the system will pause new messages until you run compaction to ensure optimal performance.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Complex Analysis Projects**: You're working with an agent to analyze multiple quarterly reports over several hours. Instead of splitting your work across multiple conversations, Context Compaction lets you maintain the full analytical thread while summarizing earlier findings.

  **Iterative Development**: You're collaborating with an agent on code development with many iterations and refinements. The conversation naturally grows long, but compaction preserves all your decisions and context without performance degradation.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  Save time by never needing to restart conversations or re-explain context. Maintain better continuity in complex projects. Work confidently knowing your agent has access to the full conversation history in an optimized format.

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  Context Compaction is now available to all users. Watch for the context usage indicator in your input bar. When it appears, you'll be guided through the process automatically. Learn more in our [documentation](/docs/user-documentation/agents/context-compaction).

  ## GMail Labels Management and Email Archiving

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Your agents can now apply labels to emails and archive messages directly in Gmail. These new capabilities extend the existing Gmail tools, giving your agents more control over inbox management.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Many workflows require not just reading emails, but organizing them too. Agents can now triage customer requests, categorize vendor communications, or clean up your inbox automatically, no manual sorting required. Combined with Wake-ups (scheduled agent runs), you can fully automate inbox maintenance.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  Agents with access to the Gmail tools can now use new actions to apply any of your existing Gmail labels and move emails to archive. These actions work alongside the existing Gmail capabilities your agents already have.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Automated inbox triage**: Set up an agent that runs every morning via Wake-ups, reviews new emails, applies labels like "Urgent", "Follow-up", or "Read Later", and archives low-priority messages.

  **Customer support categorization**: Have an agent automatically label incoming support emails by topic (Billing, Technical, Feature Request) and archive resolved threads, keeping your team's shared inbox organized.

  **Vendor communication management**: Create an agent that identifies invoices, contracts, and purchase orders in your email, applies the appropriate labels, and archives them after filing the information in your system.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Save time**: Eliminate manual email sorting and filing
  * **Stay organized**: Maintain a clean, well-labeled inbox automatically
  * **Enable new workflows**: Combine with Wake-ups for fully autonomous inbox management
  * **Reduce noise**: Archive processed emails so you can focus on what matters

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  The new label and archive capabilities require additional Gmail permissions. To enable them:

  1. Go to **Personal Settings** (bottom left of Dust)
  2. Find your Gmail connection and **disconnect** it
  3. The next time an agent needs Gmail access, you'll be prompted to **re-authenticate** with the updated permissions

  Once re-authenticated, your agents will automatically have access to the new label management and archiving tools.
</Update>

<Update label="April 29th, 2026" tags={["Added"]}>
  ## Wake-ups: Agents can now schedule themselves to continue work later

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Agents can now set their own wake-up schedules to resume work at a future time within an ongoing conversation. Think of it as giving your agent the ability to "set a reminder" for itself to check back on something, run a recurring task, or wait for a response before continuing.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Sometimes work doesn't happen all at once. You might need to wait for someone to respond, check if a condition has changed, or simply run the same process every day at 9 AM. Until now, you'd have to manually come back and prompt the agent again. With wake-ups, the agent handles the timing for you automatically.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  Agents have access to a wake-up tool that lets them schedule themselves to continue the conversation at a specific time or on a regular schedule (daily, weekly, etc.). Once scheduled, the agent will automatically "wake up" and continue where it left off.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Follow-up automation**: Ask an agent to send an email to a colleague and check back in 2 hours to see if they've responded, then proceed with next steps based on their answer.

  **Recurring updates**: Have an agent refresh a data dashboard every Monday at 9 AM, or check project status every Friday afternoon and send you a summary.

  **Real-time monitoring**: Set an agent to check an external system every 30 minutes until a specific condition is met (like a deployment completing or a document being approved).

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  No more manual follow-ups or remembering to re-prompt your agents. You can now set up truly autonomous workflows that span hours, days, or weeks, with the agent managing its own schedule and keeping work moving forward without your intervention.

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  Wake-ups are now available to all users. Ask your agent to "check back in \[time]" or "run this every \[schedule]" and it will use the wake-up tool automatically. For more details on how to configure wake-up schedules, check out the documentation: [/docs/user-documentation/agents/tools/wake-ups](/docs/user-documentation/agents/tools/wake-ups)

  ## Gong Tools Integration via MCP

  🎯 **What is it?**

  You can now connect Gong to Dust through our MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration. This allows your agents to access call transcripts and notes directly during conversations and workflows, without leaving Dust.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Sales and customer success teams have valuable insights locked in Gong recordings. By connecting Gong as a live tool, your agents can pull context from customer calls on-demand, right when you need it: preparing for a meeting, writing follow-ups, or analyzing trends.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  Once connected, Gong becomes available as a tool that your agents can use. When an agent needs information from a call, it queries Gong in real-time and retrieves the relevant transcript or notes to inform its response.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Pre-meeting preparation**: Ask an agent to "Summarize the last 3 calls with Acme Corp" and get instant context before your next meeting.

  **Customer insight synthesis**: Create a workflow that pulls key objections or feature requests from recent calls and compiles them into a weekly report.

  **Follow-up automation**: Have an agent draft personalized follow-up emails that reference specific points discussed in the most recent Gong call.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Instant access**: No manual searching through Gong. Your agents retrieve exactly what they need
  * **Better context**: Agents can reference actual customer conversations to provide more relevant responses
  * **Time savings**: Eliminate copy-pasting between tools and cut steps from your workflow

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  This feature is available to all workspaces. Check out our documentation to set up the integration: [/docs/user-documentation/agents/tools/gong](/docs/user-documentation/agents/tools/gong)

  ## GPT Image 2: Enhanced Image Generation Now Default on Dust

  🎯 **What is it?**

  OpenAI has released GPT Image 2, a new image generation model that's now the default for all image creation on Dust. This model brings significant improvements in image quality, detail rendering, and the ability to accurately generate readable text within images.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Previous image generation models often struggled with two key challenges: editing existing images effectively and incorporating clear, readable text into generated visuals. GPT Image 2 addresses both of these limitations, opening up new possibilities for creating professional-quality images that include precise text elements, something that was previously difficult or impossible to achieve consistently.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  GPT Image 2 is automatically used whenever you generate images through Dust agents or workflows. The model excels at understanding complex prompts, maintaining high fidelity to your specifications, and rendering fine details with unprecedented precision.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Marketing Materials**: Generate branded images with company names, slogans, or product descriptions clearly visible and professionally rendered, perfect for social media posts, presentations, or campaign materials.

  **Data Visualization Enhancement**: Create infographic-style images with charts, labels, and annotations that include actual readable data points and explanations, making complex information more accessible.

  **Image Editing & Iteration**: Take existing images and ask your agent to modify specific elements while preserving the overall composition, useful for refining visual assets or creating variations of existing designs.

  ## Agents can now ask you questions to clarify their next steps

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Agents can now proactively pause and ask you structured questions mid-conversation when they need clarification. Instead of guessing or making assumptions, they'll present you with single or multi-select options to help guide their next actions.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Until now, when an agent faced ambiguity, it would either guess (sometimes incorrectly), take a random path, or get stuck trying to interpret unclear instructions. Now, agents can ask you directly, turning uncertainty into a quick, interactive exchange. This prevents wasted time, reduces errors, and makes conversations feel more collaborative and intuitive.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  When an agent needs input to proceed, it will pause and present you with a clear question and predefined answer options (single-choice or multiple-choice). You select your answer, and the agent continues with exactly the information it needs.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Research workflow**: You ask an agent to "analyze our competitors." Instead of picking arbitrary companies, it asks: "Which competitors should I focus on?" with options like \[Company A, Company B, Company C, All of the above].

  **Content formatting**: You request a report summary. The agent asks: "What format do you prefer?" with options like \[Bullet points, Paragraph form, Executive summary].

  **Data prioritization**: You ask for insights from multiple sources. The agent clarifies: "Which data sources should I prioritize?" offering \[Internal reports, Public data, Customer feedback, All sources].

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **More accurate outputs**: Agents work with your explicit input instead of assumptions
  * **Faster resolution**: No back-and-forth to correct misunderstandings
  * **Better control**: You guide the agent's direction at key decision points
  * **Richer interactions**: Conversations feel more natural and collaborative

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  This feature is available by default for all agents on Dust and Deep Dive, and works in Slack conversations as well. No configuration needed: your agents will automatically ask questions when they need clarification.

  ## 🔒 Private-by-default conversation URLs

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Workspace admins can now configure Dust conversations to be private by default. When this setting is enabled, conversation URLs are only accessible to participants: anyone else who tries to access the link will see a 404 error, ensuring the conversation's existence isn't even revealed to non-participants.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  This feature addresses the risk of accidentally sharing sensitive conversations through URLs. While Dust conversations are built for collaboration, sometimes conversation links get shared unintentionally (in Slack, email, or screenshots). With private-by-default URLs, you get an extra layer of protection against accidental leakage while maintaining flexibility when you explicitly need to share.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  When a workspace admin enables this setting, all new conversations automatically become private: only people directly participating can access them via URL. Participants can still use @mentions to invite others to join conversations, and if needed, anyone in the conversation can flip it back to "accessible to workspace members" from the conversation menu.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **HR and sensitive discussions**: When discussing performance reviews, salary negotiations, or confidential employee matters, conversations stay strictly between participants even if someone accidentally copies the URL.

  **Strategic planning**: When working on confidential product launches, M\&A discussions, or competitive analysis with a small team, you can ensure the conversation doesn't leak to the broader workspace if a link is shared out of context.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Stronger security**: Reduce the risk of sensitive information leakage through shared URLs
  * **Peace of mind**: Know that conversations stay private unless you explicitly choose to share them
  * **Flexible control**: Keep the ability to make specific conversations workspace-accessible when collaboration requires it
  * **Maintain collaboration**: @mentions still work, so you can invite people without compromising privacy

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  Workspace admins can enable this feature by navigating to **Admin → Workspace Settings** and toggling the private-by-default conversation URLs setting. Once enabled, all new conversations will be private by default, while participants can override this on a per-conversation basis from the conversation menu.

  ## Import skills from GitHub or .zip file

  🎯 **What is it?**

  You can now import skills directly into Dust from a GitHub repository or by uploading a .zip file from your computer. This new capability gives you more flexibility in how you manage and deploy your skills across your workspace.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  If you're managing multiple skills or working with a team that maintains skills in a version control system, you previously had to manually copy and paste code into Dust. This new import feature allows you to centralize your skills in GitHub (or any other repository) and keep them in sync with your CI/CD pipeline, ensuring your Dust agents always use the latest versions.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  Provide a GitHub repository URL or upload a .zip file containing your skill files. Dust will import the skill structure and make it available in your workspace.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Development teams maintaining shared skills**: Your engineering team maintains a repository of company-specific skills (e.g., data formatting, internal API integrations). When you update the skill in GitHub, you can quickly re-import it to Dust to keep all agents synchronized.

  **Distributing skills across workspaces**: You've built a skill for market research and want to deploy it across multiple Dust workspaces (different departments or clients). Export it once as a .zip and import it wherever needed.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Version control**: Keep your skills in Git alongside your other code, with full history and collaboration features
  * **Automation**: Integrate skill updates into your existing CI/CD workflows
  * **Portability**: Easily share and duplicate skills across workspaces without manual copying
  * **Consistency**: Ensure all team members are using the same version of your custom skills

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  This feature is available to everyone. When creating or updating a skill, look for the new import options that allow you to specify a GitHub repository URL or upload a .zip file.

  ## Steering: Conversations That Keep Up With You

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Steering lets you send messages to Dust agents *while the agent is working*. You can now see every step of the agent's work in real-time (thinking, tool calls, searches) and redirect it on the fly without canceling or losing progress. Additionally, messages are now scoped to one agent at a time, displayed in the input bar, so you no longer need to use @mentions.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Previously, conversations with agents were strictly turn-based: you'd send a message, wait for the complete response, and only then could you course-correct if needed. This made it difficult to guide the agent early when you saw it heading in the wrong direction, and you had no visibility into what was happening behind the scenes. Steering solves this by letting you shape the output as it's being built, not after it's done.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  As soon as an agent starts working, you'll see live updates of each step it takes. If you notice it's going off track or you want to add context, send a new message, and the agent will incorporate your input immediately without restarting from scratch.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Research and analysis**: You ask an agent to research a topic, but after seeing the first few searches, you realize you need a different angle. Instead of waiting for the full response, you immediately steer it: "Actually, focus on European regulations instead."

  **Data exploration**: An agent starts querying multiple data sources, and you see it's pulling from the wrong database. You send a quick message to redirect it before it completes unnecessary work, saving time and getting accurate results faster.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Save time**: Redirect agents early instead of waiting for full responses you'll need to regenerate
  * **Better control**: Guide the conversation dynamically based on what you see happening
  * **Full transparency**: Understand exactly what the agent is doing at each moment
  * **Smoother workflow**: No more @mentions needed when working with a single agent

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  Steering is now available to everyone automatically. Start a conversation with any agent and try sending a follow-up message while it's working. For complete details and examples, visit the [full documentation](/docs/user-documentation/agents/steering-conversations).

  ## 🦊 Dust Browser Extension Now Available on Firefox

  🎯 **What is it?**

  The Dust browser extension is now officially available on Firefox! You can install it directly from the Firefox Add-ons store and enjoy the same Dust experience across all major browsers.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Many of you use Firefox as your primary browser, and until now, the Dust extension was only available on Chromium-based browsers. We've expanded our support to ensure all teams can access Dust's capabilities directly from their preferred browser, regardless of which one they use.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  Visit the Firefox Add-ons store and install the Dust extension. Once installed, you'll have quick access to your agents and Dust features right from your browser toolbar, just like on Chrome or Edge.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **For Firefox users**: Finally get the same browser integration your Chrome-using colleagues have been enjoying: quick access to agents, easy content sharing, and uninterrupted workflows without switching browsers.

  **For mixed-browser teams**: Ensure everyone on your team can use Dust extension features regardless of their browser preference, making collaboration more consistent and inclusive.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Browser flexibility**: Use Dust on Firefox, Chrome, Edge, or any Chromium-based browser
  * **Consistent experience**: Same features and functionality across all supported browsers
  * **No workflow changes**: Firefox users can now integrate Dust into their daily browsing without switching browsers

  ## Microsoft Teams Meeting Transcripts Now Available in Dust

  🎯 **What is it?**

  We've expanded our Microsoft Teams integration with two new capabilities: agents can now list your Teams meetings and retrieve their transcripts directly within Dust. This means your meeting content is now accessible to your agents, just like your other connected data sources.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Meeting discussions contain valuable information (decisions made, action items assigned, key insights shared), but this knowledge often stays locked in transcript files or requires manual review. By making transcripts accessible to your agents, you can automatically extract value from your meetings without manual work.

  ⚙️**How does it work?**

  Once your workspace admin reconnects the Microsoft Teams tool (to approve the new permissions), agents can access meeting transcripts using two new tools: one to list meetings, and another to retrieve transcript content when available.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Meeting Follow-up Agent**: Create an agent that reviews your leadership team's weekly sync, extracts action items, and sends a summary to relevant stakeholders automatically.

  **Cross-team Knowledge Capture**: Build an agent that monitors product planning meetings, identifies feature decisions and requirements, and updates your product documentation or project tracker.

  **Personal Meeting Assistant**: Set up an agent that summarizes all your meetings from the past week, highlighting decisions you participated in and tasks assigned to you.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Save time**: No more manual note-taking or transcript review
  * **Capture knowledge**: Turn meeting discussions into searchable, actionable insights
  * **Enable new workflows**: Automate meeting follow-ups, summaries, and action item tracking
  * **Connect the dots**: Let agents reference meeting decisions alongside your other company knowledge

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  **Action required**: A workspace admin must reconnect the Microsoft Teams tool in your Dust workspace to approve the new permissions (`OnlineMeetings.Read` and `OnlineMeetingTranscript.Read.All`). Once reconnected, the new meeting transcript tools will be available to all agents in workspaces using Microsoft Teams.

  ## 📧 Share Frames with specific people via email invite

  🎯 **What is it?**

  You can now invite specific people to view a Frame by sending them an email invitation. Recipients receive a direct link to access the Frame, even if they're not part of your Dust workspace.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Previously, Frame sharing was all-or-nothing at the workspace level. This new capability gives you granular control over who can see your Frames, making it much easier to collaborate with specific stakeholders, partners, or team members. You can also track who has viewed your Frame.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  When sharing a Frame, you can now enter email addresses of people you want to invite. Each person receives an email with a secure link to access that specific Frame. This respects your workspace sharing policy settings.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Executive reporting**: Share a sales dashboard Frame with your CEO and CFO without giving them access to all workspace Frames.

  **Client presentations**: Send a project status Frame directly to external clients or partners for review, while keeping other internal Frames private.

  **Cross-team collaboration**: Share specific data visualizations with stakeholders from other departments who need visibility on just that information.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Precise control**: Share Frames on a need-to-know basis instead of workspace-wide
  * **Better collaboration**: Work directly with external partners and selective internal stakeholders
  * **Visibility tracking**: See who has actually viewed your Frame
  * **Time-saving**: No more screenshots or manual exports, just send a direct link

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  This feature is now available to everyone. When viewing any Frame, look for the sharing options and select "Invite by email" to start sharing with specific people.

  ## Amplitude MCP Integration: Query Your Product Data with Natural Language

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Dust now connects directly to Amplitude through their remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. Your agents can now access Amplitude's product analytics platform to query data, analyze experiments, manage dashboards, create cohorts, and more, all through natural language conversations.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Amplitude is a leading product analytics platform that holds critical data about how users interact with your product. Until now, accessing this data required switching contexts, learning the Amplitude interface, or writing queries manually. With this integration, you can ask your Dust agents to retrieve and analyze Amplitude data conversationally, making product insights more accessible to your entire team.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  The integration uses Amplitude's official remote MCP server. Connect the appropriate server (US or EU, depending on your data residency requirements) to your Dust workspace's MCP catalog, and your agents can start querying Amplitude directly.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Product Manager reviewing experiment results**: "Show me the conversion rate for the checkout experiment we launched last week and compare it to the control group."

  **Customer Success analyzing user behavior**: "Create a cohort of users who completed onboarding in the last 30 days but haven't returned since."

  **Executive reviewing dashboard data**: "Pull the key metrics from our weekly product dashboard and summarize any significant changes from last week."

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Democratize product data**: Make Amplitude insights accessible to anyone on your team through natural language, not just analytics experts
  * **Faster decision-making**: Get answers about product performance without leaving your workflow
  * **Automated reporting**: Build agents that regularly pull and synthesize Amplitude data for stakeholder updates

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  Connect Amplitude to your Dust workspace by adding the appropriate remote MCP server to your MCP catalog:

  * **US residency**: `https://mcp.amplitude.com/mcp`
  * **EU residency**: `https://mcp.eu.amplitude.com/mcp`

  Once connected, your agents will be able to interact with Amplitude's capabilities through conversation. You'll need your Amplitude credentials to complete the setup.

  ## Notion MCP Tools Now Use Official Notion Server

  ## 📌 Context

  When you create a new Notion MCP tool in Dust, it will now use Notion's official MCP server instead of our previous implementation. We've made this change to improve both the user experience and the reliability of Notion integrations.

  ## 🔄 Impact on Dust

  We've transitioned to Notion's official MCP server, which brings two significant improvements:

  **Better authentication model ("run as you"):**

  * The tool now has access to everything you can access in Notion, no need to manually select which pages to share
  * When you modify a document or add a comment through Dust, it appears as coming from you, not from the Dust integration

  **Improved reliability:**

  * Better handling of page relations and databases
  * Faster searches and fewer loops when finding related pages
  * Overall more stable performance

  Early feedback from users has been very positive, with reports of faster and more reliable operations.

  ## 👤 Impact for you

  **If you're creating new Notion MCP tools:**

  You'll automatically benefit from the improved official implementation. The authentication flow will be simpler, and you'll experience better performance.

  **If you already have Notion MCP tools:**

  Your existing tools will continue to work exactly as before using the previous implementation. There's no disruption to your current workflows.

  **Important clarification:**

  This change only affects Notion MCP tools (created under Spaces / Add Tools). Your Notion Connector remains completely unaffected and continues to work as usual.

  ## ✅ Actions required

  **No action required on your part** for existing tools: they'll keep working as-is.

  If you have agents that used Notion tools before, you can edit them and replace them with the new tools (once you have added them to your workspace).

  ## Interactive Workspace Analytics Dashboard & Public API

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Workspace admins now have access to a full analytics dashboard directly in Dust, plus a new public API endpoint to export all your workspace data. The dashboard gives you real-time visibility into how Dust is being used across your organization (from daily active users to agent performance), all with interactive charts and CSV export capabilities. The public API (`GET /api/v1/w/{wId}/analytics/export`) lets you programmatically pull 7 different data tables (usage metrics, active users, sources, agents, users, skill usage, and tool usage) to integrate with your own BI tools.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  As a workspace admin, you need clear visibility into adoption and ROI to justify investment and drive Dust usage across your organization. Until now, getting this data required manual CSV exports or reaching out to Customer Success for custom reports. This dashboard brings Dust in line with what you expect from enterprise tools: self-serve analytics that help you make data-driven decisions.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  The interactive dashboard is available directly in your Dust workspace. You can select flexible time ranges (7, 15, 30, or 90 days), view activity trends over time, monitor adoption metrics (DAU/WAU/MAU), see usage by source (web, Slack, extension, API), explore tool usage patterns, and identify your top-performing agents. Every chart can be exported to CSV for deeper analysis. The API endpoint works with simple GET requests and returns data in CSV format for easy integration.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Executive Reporting**: Pull monthly analytics showing DAU growth and top 10 agents by usage to demonstrate ROI to leadership and secure budget for broader rollout.

  **Adoption Campaigns**: Identify departments with low WAU rates and channels where engagement is highest, then target outreach through those preferred channels (Slack vs. web vs. extension).

  **Agent Optimization**: Track which agents are being used most frequently and by whom, then deprecate underused agents and promote high-value ones in your internal communications.

  **BI Integration**: Feed the API data into Tableau, Power BI, or your internal dashboards to combine Dust metrics with other productivity KPIs across your tech stack.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Save time**: No more manual exports or waiting for CS reports
  * **Make informed decisions**: Real-time data on what's working and where to focus your efforts
  * **Prove value**: Concrete metrics to demonstrate ROI to stakeholders
  * **Flexibility**: Use the dashboard for quick insights or the API for deep integrations

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  The analytics dashboard is available now to all workspace admins on all plans. Look for the Analytics section in your workspace settings. The API endpoint is live at `GET /api/v1/w/{wId}/analytics/export`. Check our API documentation for authentication details and available data tables.

  ## Workspace Analytics: Interactive Dashboard + Public API

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Workspace admins now have access to a full analytics dashboard directly within Dust, plus a new public API endpoint for programmatic data access. The dashboard provides real-time visibility into adoption metrics (DAU/WAU/MAU), activity trends (messages, conversations), usage breakdown by source (web, Slack, extension, API), tool usage patterns, and top-performing agents. Each chart supports CSV export and offers flexible time ranges (7, 15, 30, or 90 days).

  For teams that need to integrate Dust data into their own business intelligence tools, the new `GET /api/v1/w/{wId}/analytics/export` endpoint enables programmatic access to 7 data tables: usage metrics, active users, sources, agents, users, skill usage, and tool usage.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Enterprise teams need self-service visibility into how Dust is being adopted across their organization to measure ROI and drive engagement. Until now, getting this data required manual CSV exports or reaching out to Customer Success for custom reports. This brings Dust's analytics capabilities in line with enterprise expectations for modern SaaS tools.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Executive reporting**: Export monthly adoption metrics to include in your quarterly AI transformation reports, showing DAU/MAU trends and demonstrating ROI to leadership.

  ## Slack responses: streaming, live actions & rich formatting

  **Better Slack responses for Dust agents**

  Three improvements to how Dust agents respond in Slack, shipping together.

  🔄 **Smoother streaming**

  Agent responses now appear in real time as they're being generated, using Slack's native streaming. The experience feels faster and more alive, no more waiting for a full response to land before you can start reading !

  🔎 **See what your agent is doing**

  While an agent works, a live progress indicator shows which tools it's using and what it's doing with them. For web searches, you can see the query it ran. For browsing, you can see the sites it visited and the sources it pulled from. Once the agent is done, the indicator disappears cleanly.

  ✨ **Better formatted responses**

  Tables, dividers, and code blocks now render properly in Slack. Agents that output structured content like pipeline summaries, incident reports, or side-by-side comparisons will now display the way they were meant to, without workarounds.

  <Warning>
    Responses that include file uploads use the previous format for now.
  </Warning>

  <br />

  🔥 **Concrete Use Cases**

  All your current slack use cases, improved !

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  This feature is rolling out progressively to all Slack users this week. No action required on your part, you'll automatically see these improvements in your Slack workspace when they're available.

  ## GitOps sync for Skills & Agent configurations with GitHub Action

  🎯 **What is it?**

  We've released a new official GitHub Action called `dust-github-action` that lets you manage your Dust Skills and Agent configurations directly from your Git repository. You can now version-control your Dust setup, review changes through pull requests, and automatically sync your workspace from CI/CD pipelines.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Managing Dust configurations through code gives you the same benefits you already get with your application code: change history, peer review, rollback capabilities, and automation. Instead of manually updating agents and skills in the Dust interface, you can define them in your repository and let your CI pipeline keep everything in sync. This is particularly valuable for teams that want to maintain consistency across workspaces, review configuration changes before deployment, or integrate Dust setup into their existing development workflows.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  The GitHub Action provides methods to "upsert" (create or update) Skills and Agent configurations from your repository into your Dust workspace. When you push changes to your repo or merge a PR, the action automatically applies those configuration changes to your workspace.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Development workflow**: Define your agents in YAML files in your repo, have teammates review changes in pull requests, then automatically deploy approved configurations to your production Dust workspace when merged to main.

  **Multi-workspace management**: Maintain a single source of truth for your agent configurations and sync them across development, staging, and production Dust workspaces using different GitHub Actions workflows.

  **Audit & rollback**: Track every change to your Dust setup in Git history, see who made what changes and why, and easily roll back to previous configurations if needed.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Better collaboration**: Review agent and skill changes through pull requests before they go live
  * **Version control**: Full history of all configuration changes with the ability to roll back
  * **Automation**: Reduce manual work by syncing configurations automatically from CI
  * **Consistency**: Keep multiple workspaces aligned using the same configuration source
  * **Integration**: Fits into your existing development workflows and tooling

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  The GitHub Action is available now for all workspace admins and developers using GitHub Actions. Check out the repository and documentation to get started: [https://github.com/dust-tt/dust-github-action](https://github.com/dust-tt/dust-github-action)

  The feature is in General Availability (GA) and ready for production use.

  ## Send Emails from Your Gmail Aliases

  🎯 **What is it?**

  You can now choose which email address to send from when using Dust agents with the Gmail tool. If you have aliases configured in your Gmail account (like [team@company.com](mailto:team@company.com) or [support@company.com](mailto:support@company.com)), agents can now send emails from these addresses instead of only your personal email.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Many professionals use email aliases to represent teams, departments, or shared inboxes. Until now, when an agent sent an email on your behalf, it could only use your primary Gmail address. This created limitations when you needed to maintain a specific professional identity or represent a team.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  When you ask an agent with the Gmail tool to send an email, you can now specify which of your configured Gmail aliases to use as the sender address. The agent will send the email from that alias, as long as it's properly set up in your Gmail account.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Customer Support**: Ask an agent to craft and send responses from your [support@company.com](mailto:support@company.com) alias, maintaining consistency in customer communications while saving time on routine replies.

  **Team Communications**: Have an agent send project updates or meeting summaries from your team's shared email address (like [marketing@company.com](mailto:marketing@company.com)), ensuring all correspondence appears to come from the team rather than an individual.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Professional consistency**: Maintain the right email identity for each context
  * **Team representation**: Send on behalf of groups or departments
  * **Time savings**: Automate email tasks without losing control over sender identity
  * **Better organization**: Keep communications aligned with your existing email structure

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  This feature is automatically available if you're using the Gmail tool. Ensure your aliases are configured in your Gmail account settings, then specify which address you'd like to use when asking an agent to send an email.

  ## Discover Skills - Find and leverage workspace capabilities directly in your agents

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Dust now includes a "Discover Skills" feature that allows agents to automatically find and use relevant skills from your workspace. Builders can flag specific skills as "discoverable," making them available to global agents like @dust and @deep-dive without manual configuration.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Previously, if you wanted an agent to use a specific skill, you had to manually configure it for each agent. This created friction and meant many useful workspace skills went underutilized. With discoverable skills, your agents can now intelligently tap into your organization's collective capabilities, improving the baseline experience for everyone in your workspace.

  ⚙️**How does it work?**

  Builders can mark their skills as "discoverable" when creating or editing them. Once flagged, these skills become available to global agents, which can automatically detect when a skill is relevant to a user's request and activate it on the fly.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Sales team collaboration**: A sales ops builder creates a "CRM Integration" skill and marks it discoverable. Now when anyone asks @dust about customer data, the agent automatically uses that skill without individual setup.

  **Knowledge sharing**: Your engineering team builds a "Code Review Helper" skill. Mark it as discoverable, and @deep-dive can use it whenever someone asks technical questions, instantly improving responses across the workspace.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Zero configuration**: End users get access to these skills without any setup
  * **Better agent responses**: Global agents like @dust deliver more accurate, context-aware answers by tapping into workspace expertise
  * **Increased skill adoption**: Your team's best skills get used more widely, maximizing ROI on skill development
  * **Improved baseline experience**: Everyone in the workspace benefits from collective knowledge automatically

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  **For Builders**: When creating or editing a skill, look for the new "Make discoverable" option and enable it for skills you want to share workspace-wide.

  **For Users**: Use @dust or @deep-dive as usual - they'll automatically discover and use relevant skills when needed.

  ## Create Triggers on Any Agent You Can Talk To

  🎯 **What is it?**

  You can now create your own triggers on every agent you have access to, including default agents like `dust` and `deep-dive`. Triggers allow you to automate agent interactions based on specific events or conditions, extending automation beyond just the agents you've built yourself.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Previously, trigger creation might have been limited to agents you owned or edited. We believe that if you can talk to an agent, you should be able to automate it. This opens up new automation possibilities across your entire workspace, letting you use any agent in your automated workflows.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  Create triggers directly from the Agent Details side panel of any agent you want to automate. Once created, all your triggers are centralized in your profile page where you can easily manage and monitor them.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Automated research digest**: Create a trigger on the `deep-dive` agent to automatically compile weekly competitive intelligence reports every Monday morning, even though you don't own that agent.

  **Team notification workflows**: Set up triggers on shared team agents to automatically notify specific channels when certain conditions are met, without needing editor permissions on those agents.

  **Cross-agent automation**: Build workflows that chain together multiple shared agents via triggers, creating sophisticated automation pipelines using agents created by different people across your organization.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Democratized automation**: Automate any agent you use, not just the ones you built
  * **Centralized management**: Find and control all your triggers in one place on your profile page
  * **Better collaboration**: Use agents built by colleagues in your automated workflows
  * **Transparency**: Agent editors can see and audit all triggers on their agents; admins maintain full oversight

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  1. Navigate to any agent you have access to
  2. Open the Agent Details side panel
  3. Create your trigger with your desired configuration
  4. Manage all your triggers from your profile page

  Agent editors can view and audit all triggers created on their agents directly in the builder. Workspace admins can delete any trigger if needed.

  ## API Keys Can Now Be Scoped to Multiple Spaces

  🎯 **What is it?**

  You can now configure a single API key to work across multiple spaces in your workspace, instead of being limited to one space at a time. This gives you more granular control over how integrations access your Dust environment.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Previously, if you wanted an integration to access multiple spaces, you had two options: either give it workspace-wide access (too permissive) or create separate API keys for each space (too complex). This new capability follows the principle of least privilege: you can grant access to exactly the spaces an integration needs, nothing more and nothing less.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  When creating or editing an API key in the admin UI, you can now select multiple spaces that the key should have access to. The permission resolution has been updated to handle this multi-space access smoothly.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Export shared agents**: You have an agent shared across 3 different team spaces (Sales, Marketing, Customer Success). You can now create one API key scoped to these 3 spaces to export or sync that agent's data, instead of managing 3 separate keys.

  **Controlled cross-team integration**: Your data pipeline needs to access specific spaces (Finance and Legal) but not others. You can create a single API key with access to only those two spaces, maintaining security while simplifying key management.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Better security**: Apply least-privilege principles without operational complexity
  * **Simpler management**: One key for multiple spaces instead of juggling multiple keys
  * **New workflows**: Run integrations across controlled sets of spaces that weren't practical before

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  This feature is already live for all workspace admins. When you create or manage API keys in your workspace admin panel, you'll see the option to select multiple spaces. All existing API keys have been automatically migrated, so nothing changes unless you want to adjust the configuration.

  ## Salesforce MCP Tool Can Now Create and Update Objects

  🎯 **What is it?**

  The Salesforce MCP tool has evolved beyond read access. It can now **create and update Salesforce objects** directly from within Dust. Any Salesforce object type that supports it (leads, opportunities, cases, contacts, custom objects, and more) is now writable by your agents.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Until now, agents could query Salesforce data but any updates had to be made manually in Salesforce itself. This created a gap between insight and action: you'd get the answer from your agent, then switch tools to act on it. Write access closes that loop, letting agents complete tasks end to end, from retrieving data to updating records, without you leaving the conversation.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  The Salesforce MCP tool now includes two new actions: **create object** and **update object**. Agents can call these during a conversation to write data back to your Salesforce org, using the same secure MCP connection already in place.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  * **Meeting follow-ups**: After a call summary, have your agent create a new Salesforce task, log a call note, or update an opportunity stage in one step.
  * **Lead intake**: Process form responses or email content and have your agent create a lead record in Salesforce directly.
  * **Status updates**: Ask your agent to mark an opportunity as Closed Won and update the expected close date, without opening Salesforce.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  Fewer manual data entry steps, faster CRM updates, and agents that can take meaningful action in Salesforce, not just report on it.

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  Write access is available to all users who already have the Salesforce MCP tool configured in their workspace. Use it in your existing agents. The new capabilities are available now.

  ## Email your agents directly at [agent-name@dust.team](mailto:agent-name@dust.team)

  🎯 What is it?

  You can now interact with your Dust agents directly via email. Send or forward an email to `agent-name@dust.team` and your agent will process it and reply back to you. This works just like talking to an agent in Slack or the web app, but right from your inbox.

  💡 Why is it useful?

  Many teams work primarily in email: customer support threads, vendor communications, contracts, bug reports. Until now, you had to switch to Dust's web app or Slack to get help from your agents. With email integration, agents meet you where you already work, making it faster to get answers, draft replies, or process information without context-switching.

  ⚙ How does it work?

  Once enabled in your workspace settings, you can send or forward emails to any agent using the format `agent-name@dust.team`. The agent processes your request and replies only to you (the sender). All conversations triggered by email are accessible in the Dust web app, just like agent conversations from Slack or Teams. If an agent needs authorization to use a specific tool, you'll receive a validation email with secure allow/decline links.

  ✨ Concrete Use Cases

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Customer Support**: Forward a customer complaint to your support agent and ask it to summarize the issue and suggest a reply draft.

  **Contract Review**: Send a vendor agreement to a specialized legal/compliance agent and get a quick analysis without leaving your email thread.

  **Internal Workflows**: CC an agent on an internal discussion thread and ask it to extract action items, create tickets, or draft follow-up communications.

  **Bug Triage**: Forward a bug report from a client to your technical agent for initial analysis and categorization.

  📈 Benefits for you

  * **Faster workflows**: No need to copy-paste email content into Dust, just forward and ask
  * **Stay in context**: Get agent help without leaving your inbox
  * **Flexible collaboration**: Use agents as you would a colleague: forward, CC, or send directly
  * **Consistent experience**: Same agent capabilities as Slack or web, accessible from email conversations in Dust

  🚀 How to access it?

  This feature is **opt-in**. To enable it:

  1. Go to **Workspace Settings → Capabilities → Email agents**
  2. Turn on the feature
  3. Start emailing your agents at `agent-name@dust.team`

  📖 Full documentation available here: [/docs/user-documentation/agents/integrations/send-and-forward-email-to-agents](/docs/user-documentation/agents/integrations/send-and-forward-email-to-agents)

  🔒 **Security note**: Just as you wouldn't click suspicious links in emails, avoid forwarding suspicious or untrusted emails to agents to minimize prompt injection risks.

  ## Configurable OAuth Scopes for Microsoft MCP Tools

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Admins can now customize which permissions (OAuth scopes) are requested when installing Microsoft MCP tools. When setting up tools like Outlook Mail, Outlook Calendar, Microsoft Drive, Excel, or Teams, you can uncheck optional permissions such as write access, shared mailboxes, or contacts access. Once configured, these restrictions apply automatically to all user connections in your workspace.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Many enterprise organizations have strict Azure AD policies that require minimizing permission requests. Previously, MCP tools requested all possible scopes by default, which could trigger lengthy admin consent processes or even block installation entirely. This feature gives you granular control over the permission surface, making it easier to align Dust with your organization's security policies and get approvals faster.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  During the MCP tool installation flow, admins will see a list of available OAuth scopes with checkboxes. Uncheck any optional permissions your organization doesn't need. Dust will only request the scopes you've selected, and all users in your workspace will inherit these restrictions when they connect their personal Microsoft accounts to the agent.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Read-only access**: Your security team only wants agents to read emails and calendar events, not send or modify them. Uncheck write permissions during Outlook Mail and Calendar installation.

  **No shared mailbox access**: Your organization doesn't use shared mailboxes and your IT policy forbids requesting that permission. Uncheck the shared mailbox scope when installing Outlook Mail to avoid unnecessary admin consent blockers.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Faster deployment**: Reduce admin consent friction by requesting only the minimum required permissions
  * **Better security posture**: Minimize the permission surface and align with your zero-trust policies
  * **Greater control**: Tailor each tool's access level to match your organization's specific needs

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  This feature is automatically available when installing or reconfiguring Microsoft MCP tools (Outlook Mail, Outlook Calendar, Microsoft Drive, Excel, Teams). Workspace admins will see the configurable scopes during the installation flow. If you need this capability for other MCP tools, reach out to your Customer Success Manager.

  ## Google Drive Tool: Create Files in a Folder and Share Them Directly from Dust

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Dust agents can now create Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides directly in specific folders, and automatically manage file sharing permissions. Previously, agents could only create private Google Drive files in your root directory. Now they can share files on your behalf.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  This addresses a common workflow gap: agents could analyze data, draft content, compile reports and create the Google file, but you still had to manually place it in the right folder and share it with your team. Now, agents can complete the entire workflow autonomously, saving you several manual steps every time you need to create a shared document.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  When an agent creates a Google file, you can specify both the destination folder and who should have access. The agent handles file creation, placement, and permission settings in a single action.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Weekly Team Reports**: Ask an agent to compile your team's weekly metrics into a Google Sheet, place it in your "Weekly Reports" folder, and share it with your manager and teammates automatically.

  **Client Presentation Decks**: Have an agent draft a Google Slides presentation with project updates, save it to your "Client Materials" folder, and grant view access to specific client stakeholders.

  **Meeting Notes Distribution**: Create an agent that generates meeting summaries in Google Docs, stores them in your team's shared folder, and gives edit access to all attendees.

  **Collaborative Project Documents**: Ask an agent to create a project planning doc in Google Docs within your team's project folder and automatically share edit rights with all project members.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Time savings**: Eliminate 2-3 manual steps every time you create a shared document
  * **Fewer errors**: No more forgetting to share files or placing them in the wrong folder
  * **Complete workflows**: Agents can now fully automate document creation from start to finish
  * **Better collaboration**: Files are immediately accessible to the right people without follow-up

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  If you already have Google Drive connected to Dust, this capability is available immediately. When configuring an agent or using the Google Drive tool, specify the destination folder path and the sharing permissions you need. Your agent will handle the rest!

  ## Browser Extension Now Available on Arc & Edge

  🎯 **What is it?**

  The Dust browser extension is now compatible with Arc and Microsoft Edge browsers (and all Chromium-based browsers), in addition to Chrome. You can now use Dust's browser extension on the browser that fits your workflow best.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Many teams use Arc for its innovative interface and productivity features, while Microsoft Edge is the standard browser in many enterprise environments. Until now, Dust extension users were limited to Chrome. This update ensures you can access Dust's capabilities directly in your browser of choice, wherever you work.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  The same Dust extension you know from Chrome now installs on Arc and Edge. All features work identically across browsers.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Arc users**: Integrate Dust into your split-view workflow and command bar for faster access to your agents while browsing research, documentation, or competitive analysis.

  **Edge users in enterprise environments**: Access Dust agents directly within your company's standard browser without needing to switch to Chrome for extension functionality.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  Work with Dust where you're already working: no need to switch browsers or compromise on your preferred tools. This means faster access to your agents and a more integrated workflow.

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  If you use Arc or Edge: visit the Chrome Web Store and install the Dust extension as you would for Chrome. The extension works natively on all Chromium-based browsers.
</Update>

  ## Dust Extension: Agents Now Understand Your Browser

  🎯 **What is it?**

  The Dust Chrome Extension now gives agents full browser awareness. Agents can automatically detect when they need content from your current page, work across multiple tabs simultaneously, and even interact with web pages directly through clicks and keystrokes. Plus, all your existing MCP tools (like Notion and Gmail) now work within the extension.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Until now, working with browser content required manual steps: copying text, taking screenshots, or switching back to the web app. This update removes that friction entirely. Your agents can now understand and act on what you're looking at in real-time, making browser-based workflows dramatically faster and more intuitive.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  When an agent needs information from your browser, it automatically requests permission to access the relevant tab content or screenshots. Once granted, agents can read pages, navigate between tabs, and even perform actions like filling forms or clicking buttons, all while respecting your privacy with explicit permission prompts.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Research synthesis**: Ask an agent to "summarize the key points from these three open articles" and it will analyze all tabs at once, creating a unified summary without you switching windows.

  **Form automation**: Tell an agent to "fill out this application form with information from my resume" and it can read your resume from one tab while interacting with the form in another.

  **Competitive analysis**: With multiple competitor websites open, ask "compare pricing structures across these pages" and the agent will extract and analyze the information across all tabs.

  **Email drafting with context**: While reading a LinkedIn profile or company website, ask an agent to "draft an outreach email based on this page" using your Gmail MCP tool, all without leaving your browser.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Zero context switching**: Work directly where you are without copying content or moving to the web app
  * **Faster workflows**: Agents access what they need automatically with your permission
  * **New possibilities**: Browser interaction and multi-tab awareness open up entirely new use cases
  * **Unified experience**: All your existing MCP tools now work in the extension just like in the web app

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  Update your Chrome extension to the latest version. The new capabilities are available immediately: just start a conversation with an agent and it will automatically request browser access when needed.

  ## Chrome Extension: Major Update

  🎯 **What is it?**

  The Dust Chrome Extension has been completely redesigned to bring you the full web app experience, directly in your browser. You now get access to voice input, rich text formatting, message reactions, conversation management, and much more, all without leaving your current tab.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Until now, the Chrome extension offered a simplified experience compared to the web app. Many recent features (like voice input, Frames display, or the ability to attach agents and data sources) were missing. This update closes that gap entirely, making the extension a complete, standalone way to work with Dust wherever you are on the web.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  Update your Chrome extension to the latest version. Once updated, you'll immediately see the new interface with all the features listed below.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Research & Writing**: Highlight text on any webpage, open the extension, and ask an agent to summarize, rephrase, or expand on it, using voice input if you prefer. Your draft is auto-saved, so you can close the extension and pick up where you left off.

  **Quick Access to Context**: Attach a specific data source or agent directly to your conversation in the extension, ask a question, and get an answer enriched with your company's knowledge, without opening the full web app.

  **Staying in the Flow**: Browse your conversation history, check your inbox for unread messages, and react to agent responses, all from the sidebar, while staying on your current page.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Time saved**: No need to switch between the web app and your browser: everything is accessible in one click
  * **Better efficiency**: Voice input, rich formatting, and draft auto-save make your interactions faster and smoother

  ## Notion MCP now supports databases with multiple data sources

  ### 📌 Context

  Notion introduced support for databases with multiple data sources in late 2025. Until now, the Dust Notion MCP server was using an older Notion API version that couldn't access these databases, limiting functionality for users who had adopted this new Notion feature.

  ### 🔄 Impact on Dust

  We've updated the Notion MCP server to use the newest Notion API version and adapted it to support databases with multiple data sources. This update means your agents can now query and interact with these advanced Notion databases without restrictions.

  ### 👤 Impact for you

  **If you use the Notion MCP tool**: You can now access and work with Notion databases that use multiple data sources. No more errors or missing data when your agents query these databases.

  **If you use the Notion Connector**: This update does **not** apply to the Notion Connector, which still doesn't support databases with multiple data sources. There is currently no ETA for adding this capability to the Connector.

  ### ✅ Actions required

  **No action required on your part.** If you use the Notion MCP tool with databases containing multiple data sources, they will now work automatically. You can start using this capability immediately with your existing agents.

  ## Fathom MCP Integration: Your Meeting Intelligence, Now in Dust

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Agents can now directly access your Fathom meeting recordings, summaries, and transcripts without leaving Dust. This new integration brings two tools to your agents: `list_meetings` to search and filter your call history with AI summaries and action items, and `get_transcript` to pull full conversation transcripts into your workflow.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Meeting insights often get trapped in separate tools, requiring constant copy-pasting and context-switching between platforms. With Fathom MCP integrated directly into Dust, your agents can automatically search call history, extract action items, match meetings to CRM records, and reference full transcripts, all within the same conversation where you're working. No more toggling between tabs or manually transferring information.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  Once an admin sets up the OAuth connection (either shared across the workspace or per-user), you can add the Fathom MCP to any agent in any space. The agent then has native access to your Fathom data and can filter meetings by date, team member, recording owner, or domain, while optionally pulling AI summaries and CRM matches.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Pre-meeting prep**: Ask your agent "Pull up all meetings with Acme Corp from the last quarter and summarize key discussion points" to quickly get context before your next call.

  **Follow-up automation**: Have an agent scan this week's customer calls, extract action items, and create a prioritized task list with meeting context automatically attached.

  **Sales intelligence**: Query "Show me all discovery calls from February where pricing was discussed" and get transcripts with relevant CRM data matched automatically.

  **Team knowledge sharing**: Ask an agent to find and summarize calls about a specific feature or customer pain point, turning scattered meeting insights into actionable documentation.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Save time**: Eliminate manual note-taking and copy-pasting between tools
  * **Better context**: Keep meeting intelligence directly in your agent workflows
  * **Faster decisions**: Surface relevant call history and action items on demand
  * **Improved follow-through**: Never lose track of commitments made during meetings

  ## One-Click Hex Integration via MCP Server

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Dust now supports Hex's remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server with one-click setup. This means your agents can directly interact with Hex functionality (searching projects, creating conversation threads, and iterating on data work), all without leaving Dust.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  If your team uses Hex for data analytics and notebooks, you previously had to switch between platforms to find projects, ask questions, or collaborate on analysis. This integration eliminates that context-switching by bringing Hex's capabilities directly into your Dust workflows. Your agents can now autonomously search for the right Hex project, start analytical threads, and help you iterate faster.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  Once configured, Dust agents gain access to Hex tools like `search_projects`, `create_thread`, `get_thread`, and `continue_thread`. Agents can use these tools to find relevant Hex projects based on your query, initiate analytical conversations in Hex Threads, and continue iterating on analysis, all through natural language interaction.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Data Discovery**: Ask an agent "Find our customer churn analysis from last quarter" and it searches your Hex projects directly, returning the relevant notebook.

  **Analytical Assistance**: Request "Create a thread in Hex to explore why conversion dropped in EMEA" and the agent initiates a Hex Thread, bringing context from your Dust workspace.

  **Iterative Analysis**: Continue conversations with "What if we segment by enterprise vs. SMB?" and the agent updates the Hex Thread with your new question, maintaining analytical continuity.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Faster data discovery**: No more manual searching through Hex projects

  ## Semrush MCP Integration: SEO Insights Directly in Your Agents

  🎯 **What is it?**

  The Semrush MCP Server is now available across all Dust workspaces. This integration brings professional SEO tools (including keyword research, competitive analysis, and search insights) directly into your Dust conversations. You can now access Semrush's capabilities without switching contexts or leaving your workflow.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Many teams need SEO data to inform their content strategy, competitive positioning, and marketing decisions. Previously, this meant jumping between Semrush and Dust. Now, your agents can pull real-time SEO intelligence on demand, making it faster and easier to create data-driven content, analyze competitors, or research keyword opportunities, all within your existing workflows.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  Workspace admins can connect Semrush via OAuth in **Spaces > Tools**. Once configured, any team member can enable Semrush capabilities in their agents, allowing those agents to query SEO data, analyze keywords, and retrieve competitor insights as part of their responses.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Content Strategy**: Ask an agent to analyze keyword difficulty and search volume for your target topics, then generate content briefs optimized for those keywords.

  **Competitive Intelligence**: Request competitor domain analysis to understand their top-performing pages, backlink profiles, and keyword rankings, then use those insights to inform your own strategy.

  **SEO Reporting**: Build agents that pull regular SEO metrics and package them into reports or summaries, keeping stakeholders informed without manual data gathering.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Faster insights**: Get SEO data instantly within your conversations
  * **Better decisions**: Ground content and marketing strategies in real search data
  * **Uninterrupted workflow**: No more context-switching between tools
  * **Team accessibility**: Anyone can use Semrush capabilities through agents once it's set up

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  **For admins**: Navigate to **Spaces > Tools** in your Dust workspace and connect Semrush using OAuth authentication. See the [Semrush documentation](https://www.semrush.com/kb/1618-mcp) for setup details.

  ## Introducing Sidekick: Your AI Assistant for Building Better Agents

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Sidekick is a new AI assistant integrated directly into the Agent Builder. Instead of starting from a blank canvas, you can now describe what you want your agent to do in natural language, and Sidekick will draft the instructions, recommend the right tools and skills, and suggest improvements. All changes appear as reviewable inline diffs: you accept what works and reject what doesn't. You remain in complete control.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Building effective agents often requires expertise in prompt engineering and deep knowledge of available tools. Sidekick removes this barrier by translating your intent into working agent configurations. It also helps you iterate faster by analyzing feedback, usage patterns, and suggesting concrete improvements to existing agents.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  Sidekick understands context. When you describe what you need, it may ask clarifying questions, then generates a complete agent configuration. For existing agents, it reads your current setup, reviews performance data, and proposes specific improvements as inline suggestions you can approve or dismiss with one click.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Creating a new agent**: Describe "I need an agent that monitors our #support channel and summarizes urgent tickets every morning" → Sidekick drafts the full configuration with appropriate data sources and scheduling.

  **Improving existing agents**: Open an underperforming sales research agent → Sidekick analyzes usage feedback and suggests "Add web search capability" and "Refine instructions to focus on competitor pricing" as reviewable changes.

  **Customizing templates**: Select the "Meeting Summarizer" template → Instead of generic instructions, Sidekick asks about your meeting format and adapts the template to your team's specific needs.

  **Converting conversations**: Had a productive back-and-forth with an agent? Use "Convert to agent" → Sidekick captures that conversation's tools, knowledge sources, and reasoning pattern into a reusable agent.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Faster agent creation**: Go from idea to working agent in minutes, not hours
  * **Better quality**: Benefit from best practices built into Sidekick's recommendations
  * **Continuous improvement**: Get data-driven suggestions to optimize existing agents
  * **Lower barrier to entry**: Build sophisticated agents without needing prompt engineering expertise

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  Sidekick is now available to all users directly in the Agent Builder. Open any agent or click "New Agent" to get started.

  ## Enhanced Attachments Management in Conversations

  🎯 **What is it?**

  The conversation Attachments popover has been completely redesigned to give you better visibility and control over all files in your conversations. You can now see both uploaded files and agent-generated content in one organized view, filter by content type, and get visual notifications when new content is added.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  During long conversations with agents, files and generated content can quickly pile up, making it hard to find that specific document or output you need. This improvement solves the common "where did that file go?" problem by centralizing all conversation content in an easy-to-browse interface with smart filtering options.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  When you click the Attachments button in any conversation, you'll now see a full table/preview of all content. New category filters let you narrow down by type (uploads vs. generated files), and the Attachments button will pulse whenever new content appears in the conversation, so you never miss important outputs.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Research & Analysis**: When working with an agent that generates multiple reports and charts, use the filters to quickly locate all generated visualizations versus your original source documents.

  **Document Management**: In conversations where you've uploaded several files and received edited versions back, easily distinguish between your uploads and agent outputs to grab the right version.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Save time**: No more scrolling through long conversations to find a specific file
  * **Better organization**: Clear separation between uploaded and generated content
  * **Never miss content**: Visual pulse notification alerts you to new files immediately
  * **Easier reuse**: Quick access to generated content for download or sharing

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  This feature is now live for all users, no action needed. Open any conversation and click the Attachments button to experience the improved interface.

  ## BigQuery connector: multi-project support

  🎯 **What is it?**

  The BigQuery connector now supports multiple GCP projects within a single connection. Instead of being limited to one project (the service account's default `project_id`), Dust now automatically discovers and lists all GCP projects accessible by your service account, letting you browse datasets and tables across all of them.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Many organizations structure their BigQuery data across multiple GCP projects for governance, billing separation, or organizational reasons. Previously, the connector only accessed a single hardcoded project, forcing you to create multiple connections or miss out on data stored in other projects. This update removes that limitation entirely.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  When you connect BigQuery, Dust now queries all projects your service account can access and presents them in a unified view. You can browse and select datasets and tables from any accessible project without additional configuration.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Cross-project analytics**: Build agents that combine data from your production project, analytics project, and data warehouse project, all from a single BigQuery connection.

  **Multi-team access**: If your service account has access to projects owned by different teams (marketing, sales, engineering), your agents can now query data from all of them.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * Access all your BigQuery data through one connection instead of managing multiple connectors
  * Build agents that work with data across your entire GCP organization
  * Simpler setup and maintenance for multi-project BigQuery architectures

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  This improvement is available by default for all BigQuery connector users. If you're already using the BigQuery connector, you'll automatically see all accessible projects the next time you browse your data sources. No configuration changes needed.

  **📌 Context**

  Previously, the Slack tool in Dust was using a non-approved Slack app. This caused a security warning to appear when connecting, and in some cases, it completely blocked the connection for companies with strict security policies that only allow approved Slack apps.

  We've now upgraded the Slack tool to use our official Dust app from the Slack Marketplace, the same trusted app that powers the Slack bot you may already be using.

  **🔄 Impact on Dust**

  Dust now provides a unified, approved Slack integration across all features. The Slack tool connection flow has been updated to use our official Marketplace app, ensuring a smooth and secure experience.

  **👤 Impact for you**

  **If you're already using the Slack tool:** No impact. Your existing connection will continue to work without any interruption.

  **If you're setting up a new Slack tool connection:** You'll now connect through our official Dust Marketplace app. This means:

  * No more security warnings during connection
  * Works even if your company policy restricts non-approved apps
  * Cleaner, more trustworthy connection experience

  **✅ Actions required**

  No action required on your part.

  If you previously couldn't connect the Slack tool due to company policy restrictions, you can now try again. The official app should be approved by your security settings.

  ## 🆕 Dust Agents Can Now Create and Edit Google Drive Documents

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Dust agents can now create and modify Google Drive files directly. This means your agents can generate new Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides from scratch, edit existing documents, add comments, format content, and even insert tables, all without you having to do it manually.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Until now, agents could only read your Google Drive files. This limitation meant that after analyzing data or processing information, you still had to manually create documents or update spreadsheets with the results. This new capability removes that friction entirely, allowing your agents to complete the full workflow: from analysis to documentation to sharing.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  When you connect your Google Drive to Dust using the updated OAuth permissions (`drive.file` scope), your agents gain the ability to perform write operations on Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides. They can create new files, clone templates, edit content, format text, and manage comments.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Weekly Report Generation**: Your agent analyzes your team's project management data, identifies key metrics and blockers, then automatically creates a formatted Google Doc with action items, ready to share with stakeholders.

  **Meeting Notes & Follow-ups**: After a meeting transcription is processed, your agent creates a Google Doc with structured notes, extracts action items into a tracking spreadsheet, and adds comments tagging relevant team members.

  **Data Pipeline to Spreadsheet**: Your agent pulls sales data from multiple sources, performs analysis, then updates a Google Sheet with the latest figures for your monthly review.

  **Project Status Updates**: Your agent monitors project channels, synthesizes updates, and automatically updates your project status document in Google Docs with formatted sections and tables.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Save hours of manual work**: Eliminate the copy-paste cycle between analysis and documentation
  * **Maintain consistency**: Agents follow your templates and formatting standards every time
  * **Enable end-to-end automation**: Complete workflows from data gathering to polished deliverables
  * **Improve collaboration**: Agents can comment and tag team members directly in documents

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  If you already have Google Drive connected to Dust, you'll be prompted to re-authenticate with the updated permissions the next time an agent attempts a write operation. If you're new to this integration, connect Google Drive from your Dust connections settings, and all write capabilities will be available immediately to your agents.

  ## 🔗✨ Message Reactions & Message Links in Conversations

  🎯 **What is it?**

  You can now react to messages with emojis and share direct links to specific messages within Dust conversations. This makes it easier to reference important points, navigate through discussions, and express quick feedback without writing a full response.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  As conversations grow longer and more collaborative, it becomes harder to track key decisions, highlight important information, or quickly acknowledge messages. Emoji reactions provide a lightweight way to respond, while message links allow you to jump directly to or reference specific points in a conversation. No more endless scrolling to find "that one message."

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  Hover over any message in a conversation to reveal the reaction and link options. Click to add an emoji reaction, or copy the message link to share it with your team or bookmark it for later reference.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Team alignment**: React with a ✅ to show agreement on a decision without cluttering the conversation with "+1" messages, helping your team quickly see consensus.

  **Knowledge sharing**: Copy a direct link to a valuable assistant response (like a complex analysis or summary) and share it in your team channel or documentation, making it easy for colleagues to find exactly what they need.

  **Follow-up tracking**: Use 👀 reactions to show you've seen an important update, or react with ❓ to flag messages that need clarification, creating visual cues for what requires attention.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Save time**: No need to write short acknowledgment messages, a quick emoji does the job
  * **Better navigation**: Jump directly to key messages instead of searching through long conversations
  * **Clearer communication**: Visual reactions help the whole team understand what's important, what's been addressed, and what needs attention
  * **Better collaboration**: Make conversations more dynamic and easier to follow for everyone involved

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  This feature is now available to all Dust users in all conversations, no setup required! Just hover over any message to start using reactions and message links right away.

  ## Granola Official MCP Server Now Available in Dust

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Granola's official MCP (Model Context Protocol) server is now directly configurable within Dust. This native integration allows your Dust assistants to access and interact with your Granola meeting data directly.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  If you use Granola to record and manage your meetings, you can now use that meeting information directly within your Dust workflows. No more switching between tools or manually copying meeting notes: your assistants can automatically retrieve and work with your meeting data.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  Once configured, the Granola MCP server connects your Granola account to Dust, enabling your assistants to query meetings, retrieve specific meeting details, and list your meeting history.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Meeting Follow-up Assistant**: Create an assistant that automatically pulls action items from recent Granola meetings and drafts follow-up emails to participants.

  **Weekly Meeting Digest**: Build a workflow that compiles summaries of all your team meetings from the past week, highlighting key decisions and next steps.

  ## CSV Export for Programmatic Cost Chart

  🎯 **What is it?**

  You can now export your programmatic cost chart as a CSV file. This makes it easy to download your usage data and analyze it further outside of Dust.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  The in-app chart gives you a visual overview of your spending, but deeper analysis (filtering by team, building custom reports, or combining with other data) is easier when you have the raw data. CSV export gives you that without any additional setup.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  From the programmatic cost chart view, you'll find an export button that downloads your current chart data as a CSV file. The data reflects whatever filters and time range you have applied.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  * **Finance reporting**: Export monthly usage data and import it into your billing or finance tools for reconciliation.
  * **Team-level analysis**: Filter by workspace or use case, export, and share with relevant stakeholders.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  A simple way to get your usage data out of Dust and into the tools where you do your financial analysis.

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  ## 🆕 Statuspage MCP Server Integration Now Available

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Dust now integrates with Atlassian Statuspage through a dedicated MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. Your agents can now directly interact with your Statuspage infrastructure to manage incidents, update component statuses, and monitor your system's health, all through natural conversation.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  When an incident occurs, speed and coordination are critical. This integration eliminates context-switching between tools and enables your DevOps teams and SREs to manage incident communication workflows without leaving Dust. Instead of manually logging into Statuspage to update statuses or create incident reports, your agents can handle these tasks instantly based on your instructions or automated triggers.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  Admins configure the integration by adding their Statuspage API key to Dust. Once set up, agents can access Statuspage on-demand to perform key operations: listing pages and components, checking ongoing incidents, creating new incidents, updating incident details, and marking components as experiencing outages.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Automated Incident Response**: Ask an agent "Create a Statuspage incident for the API outage we're experiencing" and it instantly creates the incident, sets the appropriate component status, and can even draft customer-facing updates based on your internal incident notes.

  **Status Monitoring Dashboard**: Configure an agent to regularly check your Statuspage for ongoing incidents and provide morning briefings to your on-call team, summarizing what's currently under maintenance or experiencing issues.

  **Coordinated Communication**: During an incident, ask your agent to "Update the database incident with investigating status and ETA of 30 minutes" while you focus on actually resolving the technical issue.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Faster incident response**: Reduce the time between detection and public communication
  * **Reduced cognitive load**: Let agents handle status updates while your team focuses on resolution
  * **Consistent communication**: Ensure incident updates follow your established workflows and templates
  * **Centralized operations**: Manage incident communication alongside your other operational tasks in Dust

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  This integration is available on-demand for all Dust users with a Statuspage account. Workspace admins need to configure the Statuspage API key in your Dust workspace settings. Once configured, enable the Statuspage capability for any agent that needs incident management access.

  ## 📊 Agent Builder Insights: Real-time Observability Dashboard

  🎯 **What is it?**

  The Agent Builder now features an observability dashboard that gives you real-time visibility into how your agents are performing. You can track usage trends, monitor which tools are being executed, analyze user feedback, measure response times, and understand how your retrieval systems are behaving, all linked to specific versions of your agents.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  AI agents often fail quietly in production. A prompt change might slow down responses, a tool update could break a workflow, or retrieval quality might degrade, and you won't know until frustrated users report it. This dashboard shifts you from reactive troubleshooting to proactive monitoring, letting you catch issues before they impact your team and understand the real-world impact of every change you make.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  The dashboard automatically collects performance data from your agents in real-time. Every conversation, tool execution, and retrieval query is tracked and visualized, with metrics tied to specific agent versions so you can compare performance before and after changes.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Validate prompt improvements**: You updated an agent's instructions to be more concise. Check the dashboard to see if average latency decreased and if user feedback scores improved compared to the previous version.

  **Debug tool execution issues**: Users mention an agent isn't providing complete answers. The dashboard reveals that a specific API tool is timing out 40% of the time, pointing you directly to the problem.

  **Optimize retrieval quality**: After adding new documents to your knowledge base, monitor RAG behavior metrics to ensure the agent is retrieving relevant information and not getting overwhelmed by irrelevant context.

  **Track adoption and impact**: See which agents are being used most frequently, during what times, and by which teams, helping you prioritize maintenance and development efforts.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Catch problems early**: Identify performance degradation or failures before they become widespread issues
  * **Make data-driven decisions**: Understand the real impact of configuration changes instead of guessing
  * **Save troubleshooting time**: Pinpoint the exact version and component causing issues
  * **Build confidence**: Deploy agent updates knowing you can monitor their real-world performance immediately

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  Open any agent in the Agent Builder. You'll find the new Insights tab alongside your existing configuration options. The dashboard is available immediately for all users, no setup or activation required.

  ## Daily Spending Cap for API Usage

  📌 Context

  To help you maintain better control over your costs and protect against unexpected spending spikes, we've introduced a daily spending cap for all API (programmatic) usage on Dust.

  This safeguard automatically monitors your API consumption and prevents runaway costs from accidental loops, misconfigured scripts, or unexpected usage patterns.

  🔄 Impact on Dust

  We've implemented real-time tracking that:

  * Monitors your API spending throughout the day
  * Automatically resets at midnight UTC each day
  * Uses a fail-safe approach: if our tracking system encounters any issues, API calls are temporarily blocked to ensure you're never surprised by unexpected charges

  👤 Impact for you

  **Default limits:**

  * Standard workspaces: \$1,000 per day
  * Pay-as-you-go workspaces: The greater of \$1,000 or 20% of your monthly spending cap, per day

  **What this means:**

  * For most customers, daily API usage will continue without any interruption
  * If you approach your daily cap, API calls will be blocked until the next day (midnight UTC)
  * You'll have full visibility into your spending and won't encounter surprise bills from runaway usage

  **Need a different limit?**

  If your typical API usage requires a higher daily cap, you can request a custom limit between $100 and $10,000 through your account settings or by contacting your Customer Success Manager.

  ✅ Actions required

  **No immediate action required** for most customers. Your existing API integrations will continue to work within the default daily limits.

  **Optional:** If you regularly use the API extensively, we recommend:

  1. Reviewing your typical daily API spending patterns
  2. Contacting us if you need to adjust your daily cap to match your usage
  3. Implementing monitoring in your applications to track daily usage

  This change is live for all workspaces starting today.

  ## Export Frames as PDF

  🎯 What is it?

  You can now export any Frame as a PDF document directly from Dust. When exporting, you can choose between portrait or landscape orientation to best fit your content. Enterprise plans receive clean PDFs without any branding, while other plans include a discreet "Created with Dust" footer.

  💡 Why is it useful?

  Frames are visual tools for data analysis, reports, and presentations within Dust. However, many of you needed to share these insights outside the platform, whether for compliance documentation, distribution to external vendors, or integration into company repositories like SharePoint. This was one of your most requested features, and we're excited to make sharing your work easier.

  ⚙ How does it work?

  Open any Frame and select the export option. Choose your preferred orientation (portrait or landscape), and Dust will generate a PDF version of your Frame in seconds. The export handles most Frame layouts automatically.

  ✨ Concrete Use Cases

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Compliance & Documentation**: Export weekly analytics Frames as PDFs for compliance archives or audit trails in your document management system.

  **External Reporting**: Share performance dashboards or project status Frames with external partners, vendors, or clients who don't have Dust access.

  **Executive Presentations**: Convert data visualizations into PDFs for inclusion in board presentations, SharePoint libraries, or email distributions.

  **Offline Access**: Create PDF versions of critical Frames for offline reference during travel or in low-connectivity environments.

  📈 Benefits for you

  * **One-click sharing**: Transform interactive Frames into universally accessible PDF documents instantly
  * **Professional output**: Clean, presentation-ready documents suitable for any audience
  * **Flexibility**: Choose the orientation that best showcases your content
  * **Broader reach**: Share your Dust insights with anyone, regardless of their access to the platform

  🚀 How to access it?

  The feature is already live for all users! Navigate to any Frame you've created or have access to, and look for the export/PDF option. No setup or activation required: start exporting today.

  **Note**: While PDF export is designed to handle a wide variety of Frame layouts, from standard reports to advanced visualizations, we're continuously improving the feature to support even the most creative Frame designs. If you encounter any issues with specific layouts, please let us know so we can refine the experience.

  ## Per API-Key Usage Cap

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Admins can now set a spending limit on individual API keys. Each key can have its own maximum dollar amount for API usage, calculated on a 30-day rolling basis. This gives you precise control over how much each API integration or user can spend.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  As your team scales and more people use Dust programmatically, it becomes harder to track and control costs at a granular level. Until now, your only option was a workspace-wide limit. This new feature helps you prevent budget overruns, test new integrations safely, and allocate resources more strategically across different projects or teams.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  Set a dollar cap when creating or editing an API key. Once the key reaches that spending limit within any 30-day period, it will stop working until the rolling window resets. Keys without a cap continue to use the workspace's overall limit.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Testing environment**: Set a \$50 cap on API keys used for development and testing to avoid unexpected costs from runaway scripts or experiments.

  **Team allocation**: Give your marketing team an API key with a $500 monthly cap and your engineering team a separate key with a $2,000 cap, matching each team's actual needs and budget.

  **Third-party integrations**: When connecting Dust to external tools or contractors, set conservative limits to control costs while you evaluate usage patterns.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Better budget control**: Prevent individual integrations or users from consuming your entire workspace credit unexpectedly
  * **Safe experimentation**: Test new use cases without risking your full budget
  * **Clearer accountability**: Track and manage costs at the team or project level
  * **Flexible scaling**: Adjust limits as needs change without affecting your entire workspace

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  Admins can access this feature in the Dust workspace settings, under the API Keys section. When creating a new API key or editing an existing one, you'll find the option to set a usage cap. No action is required if you prefer to keep your current setup: API keys without a cap will continue to work as before, limited only by your workspace's overall limit.

  ## 📬 Email Notifications Now Include Conversation Summaries

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Your Dust notification emails now include an AI-generated summary of unread messages. Instead of just being notified that you have new activity, you'll see a concise overview of what's been discussed directly in your inbox.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  We know your inbox is busy, and context switching takes time. With this update, you can quickly assess what's happening in your Dust conversations without needing to immediately open the app. This helps you prioritize which conversations need your immediate attention and which can wait.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  When you have unread messages in a Dust conversation, the notification email you receive will automatically include a brief summary of the key points discussed. This summary is generated to give you the essential context at a glance.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Prioritizing your morning**: Scan your email summaries over coffee to decide which conversations need your immediate input and which can be reviewed later in the day.

  **Staying informed on-the-go**: Quickly catch up on team discussions from your mobile email app while commuting, without needing to switch apps or log into Dust.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Save time**: Get context without opening multiple apps
  * **Stay informed**: Keep up with important conversations even when you're away from Dust
  * **Better prioritization**: Quickly identify which messages need your urgent attention

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  ## Discover Existing Skills Before You Build – Automatic Similar Skills Detection

  🎯 **What is it?**

  When you create a new skill in Dust, the platform now automatically scans your workspace to detect if similar skills already exist. As you write your skill description, AI analyzes it in real-time and alerts you if it finds potential matches, helping you discover skills you could reuse or build upon.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Building skills takes time and effort. Without visibility into what already exists, teams often recreate the same automation multiple times, leading to fragmented knowledge, inconsistent results, and wasted time. This feature helps you maintain a clean, organized skill library by surfacing relevant existing work before you start from scratch.

  ⚙️ **How does it work?**

  As you type your skill description during creation, Dust's AI compares it against all custom skills in your workspace. If it detects similarities, you'll see a notification suggesting existing skills you might want to review or reuse instead.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Avoiding duplicates**: You're about to create a skill to "Create GitHub issues from meeting notes." Before you finish, Dust alerts you that "GitHub Issue Creator" already exists in your workspace, built by a colleague last month with the exact same purpose.

  **Building on existing work**: You start creating a skill for "Slack notifications on deal closures." Dust surfaces a similar skill called "CRM to Slack Updates" that you can either reuse directly or modify to fit your specific needs.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Save time**: Reuse existing skills instead of building from scratch
  * **Maintain consistency**: Reduce skill sprawl and duplicate automations across your workspace
  * **Discover team knowledge**: Find expertise and solutions your colleagues have already created
  * **Keep your workspace organized**: No more "Create Report v1, v2, v3" cluttering your skill library

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  This feature is automatically active for all builders. Start creating a new skill as usual. If similar skills exist, Dust will notify you while you're writing the description. No configuration needed.

  ## 📧 Gmail Integration: Send Emails Directly from Dust

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Your Gmail integration on Dust can now send emails directly. Previously, Dust could only read, search your Gmail messages and create drafts. Now your assistant can compose and send emails on your behalf through the Gmail tool.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  This feature addresses one of our most requested capabilities from customers. It enables your Dust assistants to take action on your behalf, not just retrieve information. You can now automate email workflows, draft responses, and send communications without leaving your conversation with Dust.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  Once enabled, your assistant can use the Gmail "send mail" tool to compose and send emails directly from your Gmail account. The assistant will handle the email composition based on your instructions.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Automated follow-ups**: Ask your assistant to "send a follow-up email to the prospects who haven't responded in the last 7 days" based on your CRM data and email history.

  **Quick responses**: "Draft and send a thank you email to John after our meeting, mentioning the key points we discussed about the Q1 roadmap."

  **Batch communications**: "Send a weekly summary email to my team with the top 5 updates from our project documentation."

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Save time**: Automate routine email tasks and responses
  * **Stay in flow**: Send emails without switching between tools
  * **Increase efficiency**: Let your assistant handle email drafts and sends based on your knowledge and context

  🚀 **How to access it?**

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  Creating high-quality visual content often requires combining multiple references, understanding nuanced creative direction, and producing outputs at professional resolutions. This upgrade addresses these needs by giving you more flexibility and better results when generating or editing images through Dust.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  The new engine processes more complex prompts with better accuracy and allows you to upload up to 14 reference images. These references can be used to edit existing assets or to compose entirely new images by combining multiple visual elements.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Marketing Materials**: Upload your brand guidelines, product photos, and mood board references (up to 14 images) to generate on-brand marketing visuals in 4K resolution for print and digital campaigns.

  **Design Iteration**: Provide multiple variations of a design concept and use detailed creative instructions to generate refined versions that blend the best elements of your references.

  ## 🆕 Skills: Share Expertise Across All Your Agents

  🎯 **What is it?**

  Skills is a new capability that allows you to package instructions, knowledge, and tools into reusable modules. Once created, any agent in your workspace can access these Skills. When you update a Skill, all agents using it automatically benefit from the improvement, no need to manually update each agent.

  💡 **Why is it useful?**

  If you're building multiple agents for your team, you've probably noticed yourself copying and pasting the same instructions or configurations over and over. Skills solves this problem by letting you define something once and share it everywhere. It's designed to help builders spread their expertise efficiently and improve the agent-building experience for everyone in your workspace.

  ⚙ **How does it work?**

  You create a Skill by bundling together specific instructions, relevant knowledge sources, and tools. Once created, any agent can be equipped with that Skill. If you refine or update the Skill later, every agent using it instantly improves.

  ✨ **Concrete Use Cases**

  Here's how you could use it:

  **Standardized research methodology**: Create a "Market Research" Skill that includes your company's research framework, access to your research databases, and web search tools. Every agent tasked with research will follow the same rigorous process.

  **Consistent brand voice**: Build a "Brand Communication" Skill containing your tone of voice guidelines, brand vocabulary, and approved messaging. All customer-facing agents will automatically maintain your brand standards.

  **Domain expertise**: Package your team's specialized knowledge (like "Financial Analysis," "Legal Compliance," or "Technical Support") so any agent can use expert-level capabilities without you rebuilding the context each time.

  📈 **Benefits for you**

  * **Save time**: Build once, use everywhere, no more duplicating work across agents
  * **Maintain consistency**: Ensure all agents follow the same standards and best practices
  * **Scale expertise**: Share specialized knowledge across your entire workspace
